These promises are also typically enforced via a legal contract. There might also be other promised activities, with or without a contract, that are valuable to document if known. This could include the promise to produce an artwork in exchange for money, typically called a commission.\n\nThere is a necessary vocabulary term, given the lack of a more explicit class to model activity plans or social bonds, in order to distinguish a Promise from any other activity.\n\n* __Promise:__ (_aat:300435599_) A promise that some future activity will be carried out.\n\n\n## Promised Gift\n\nA promise of a gift (or sale, or exchange) is an Activity which is carried out by the promising party.  It is a promise to some other actor to perform some further activity (the giving or sale of the object), however the model currently cannot describe the future planned event. Instead we can reference the promised party and the object being promised only via the more general properties of `participant` and `used_specific_object` respectively.\n\nFurther details and clarification about the promise, including any description of the contract, should be given in a descriptive note on the promise activity.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThomas Jaffe has promised to give the 19th Century Indo-Pacific Coffin to Yale University Art Gallery.\n\n",

   "source": "\n\n## Commissions for Artwork\n\nAnother type of promise can occur even before the artwork is produced: a commission from a sponsor for the production of the work. This starts out with paired promises, where the artist promises to produce the work, and the commissioner promises to pay for it.  There might be some amount of money paid to the artist in advance, or other transfers of custody or ownership of objects, such as lending something to the artist to produce a copy of.  Given the potential for multiple exchanges of promises, money, and objects, the description of the commissioning activity fits cleanly into the broader Provenance Entry model.\n\nThe description of the production of the commissioned object is taken care of by the regular production pattern, as described in the [object](/model/object/) section. The subsequent transfer of title to the new owner, and the payment of any monies due to the artist is a second provenance entry following all of the regular patterns.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe \"Nuveen Painting\" by Jim Dine was commissioned by Richard Franke in 1985.\n\n",
