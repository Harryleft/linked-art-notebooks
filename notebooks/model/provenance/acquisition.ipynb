The acquisition is the transfer of the right of ownership of an object (referenced in `transferred_title_of`) from the seller (in `transferred_title_from`) to the buyer (in `transferred_title_to`). \n\nEach object has its own Acquisition as part of the provenance event, so if a collector buys three paintings from a dealer, then there would be a single Provenance Event with three Acquisitions, all of which transfer the title of a single painting from the dealer to the collector.\n\n\n__Example:__\n\nOliver Payne acquired Spring from the Durand-Ruel Gallery in New York in 1909\n\n",

   "source": "\n\n\n## Payments\n\nA purchase is a common type of acquisition in which money is exchanged for the object.  The provenance event consists of the acquisition along with one or more related payments.  This typically involves a payment from the seller to the buyer for the agreed upon price, but might include further payments to or from others such as for shared ownership, payment of debts owed, or for services rendered as part of the overall activity.\n\nThe `Payment` activity has equivalent relationships for the actor that the money is transferred from (`paid_from`), the actor the money is transferred to (`paid_to`), and the amount of money paid (`paid_amount`).  The amount itself is a `MonetaryAmount` that has a value (`value`) and a currency (`currency`).  Each separable monetary amount is modeled as an individual instance of `Payment`, and thus if the buyer paid a commission to the agent who carried out the purchase, and paid for the object, then there would be two Payments, one from the buyer to the seller and one from the buyer to the agent. Commissions to auction houses or for consignments would use the same pattern.\n\n!!! note \"Diachronic Comparison of Monetary Amounts\"\n    The underlying ontology has specified that the `MonetaryAmount` refers to the face value of the combination of value and currency. This means that any comparison between `MonetaryAmount` instances should also take into account the datetimes of resources that reference it, rather than standing alone. It is unclear if the same `MonetaryAmount` can be used for all occurences of value and currency, or whether it is something more unique than that, and to be safe the model assumes that one instance will only be used in a single `Payment`.\n\n__Example:__\n\nÉdouard Manet sold his painting, Jeanne, to Antonin Proust in 1883 for 3,000 francs.\n\n",
