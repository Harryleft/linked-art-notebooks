Please think carefully before choosing another concept for one in the lists below as it will be much harder to compare your data with others', however it will still be valid Linked Art if you do pick a different concept.\n\nWe are aware that unfortunately some of the lists here can be biased towards the needs of the first Linked Art implementers, and welcome any help in mitigating such biases. If you have suggestions for new terms or any other type of feedback, please do not hesitate to [reach out](https://linked.art/community/)!\n\n<style>\n\ttable {width: 100% ; table-layout: fixed}\n\ttr th:first-child {width: 18em}\n\ttr th:nth-child(2) {width: 10em}\n\ttr th:nth-child(3) {text-align: left}\n</style>\n\n## 类型s\n\n### 名称 类型s\n\nSee the [name documentation](/model/base/#names).\n\n| 名称                  | URI           | 描述 |\n|-----------------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Alternate 名称        | aat:300264273 | An alternate name, as opposed to the primary name, of an entity |\n| Given 名称            | aat:300404651 | The given or first name of a Person |\n| Middle 名称           | aat:300404654 | The middle name of a Person |\n| Family 名称           | aat:300404652 | The family or sirname of a Person |\n| Former 名称           | aat:300435719 | A former name, for any reason, of a Person |\n\n\n### 标识符 类型s\n\nSee the [identifier documentation](/model/base/#identifiers).\n\n| 名称                  | URI           | 描述 |\n|-----------------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Accession Number      | aat:300312355 | An accession number for the object |\n| Local Number          | aat:300404621 | An identifier assigned by the institution but not an accession or system number |\n| System Number         | aat:300435704 | An identifier assigned by an automated system, such as a collection management system |\n| Call Number           | aat:300311706 | An identifier for where the object is physically in the repository, typically used in libraries |\n\n\n### 声明 类型s \n\nThese are embedded Linguistic Objects within other records.
