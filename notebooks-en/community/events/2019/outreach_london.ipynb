At this event, supported by the AHRC-funded Linked Art Research Network, we will introduce the model and its uses, and engage with individuals and institutions who are positioned to adopt the model. All are welcome, and we encourage the attendance and contribution of curators, collection managers, educators, museum technologists, and researchers whose studies include digital collections. \n\nThe first half of the day will present an overview of work-to-date on the Linked Art model, including its use, benefits, implementation, and challenges of Linked Open Usable Data in an art museum environment. This will include examples of how the Linked Art model is being used to publish collections data.\n\nThe subsequent afternoon session will switch to a workshop format, with smaller focussed groups discussing the uses and potential of Linked Art. We anticipate discussion groups will consider topics such as catalogues, provenance, exhibitions, citations, educational materials, and academic scholarship, along with any other relevant themes proposed by those present. While the focus of the current Linked Art model is artworks, art provenance, and art history, we foresee future opportunities for extending the model -- and applying the principles and practices it embodies -- across wider cultural heritage data scenarios. Discussion of these broader possibilities will also be accommodated during break-out sessions.\n\nMembers of the Linked Art Editorial Board will participate in group discussions, giving attendees the opportunity to reflect upon applications which interest them most with those who know the model best, sharing experiences and best practice. Furthermore, the insights gathered from attendees will be used to inform potential future revisions and extensions of the Linked Art model, and identify opportunities for new collaborations and research. \n\nThe day will finish in plenary with summaries from the discussion groups, followed by informal social events in the evening, to which everyone is invited to attend.\n\n## Schedule\n\n\n* 10:00 Victoria and Albert Museum opens\n* 10:15 Welcome and Introduction (Hochhauser Auditorium)  \n* 10:30 Introducing Linked Art: Technologies, Applications, Exemplars, Possibilities\n* 12:30 Lunch (provided for full-day attendees)\n* 1:30 Group Discussions (Design Studios)\n* 3:00 Break\n* 3:30 Group Discussions (Design Studios)\n* 5:00 Group reporting and conclusions\n\n## Registration\n\nAttendance is free, although places are limited and advanced registration is required at: [https://www.eventbrite.com/e/linked-art-networking-digital-collections-and-scholarship-tickets-65548847367](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/linked-art-networking-digital-collections-and-scholarship-tickets-65548847367)\n\nTickets are available for the full day event (including the afternoon workshop), or for the morning presentations only.\n\nEventbrite processes data (including any personal data you may submit by booking this event) outside of the European Economic Area.

Kress Foundation for its support of the work of the Editorial Board.\n\nMembers of the Linked Art Editorial Board participate through the support of their institutions, which include: Academia Sinica, The American Numismatics Society, The Canadian Heritage Information Network, Colby College, Design for Context, ETH Zurich, Europeana, FORTH, The Frick Collection, Harvard University (I Tatti), The Indianapolis Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, The Louvre, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Modern Art (New York), National Gallery of Art (USA), The University of Oxford University, The Philadephia Museum of Art, Princeton Art Museum, The Rijksmuseum, The Smithsonian Institution, The Victoria and Albert Museum, The Yale University Center for British Art, and The Zeri Foundation.\n\n## Related Event: Linked Conservation Data workshop\n\t \t \t\nLinked Conservation Data (LCD) is a Network of partners funded under the same AHRC programme as Linked Art. The aim of the Network is to discuss and report on ways that conservation documentation can be disseminated and re-used more effectively through Linked Data.\n\nThe [next LCD workshop](https://www.ligatus.org.uk/lcd/meeting/modelling) will focus on data modelling, and will take place on 12-13 September 2019 in London, UK. During this workshop participants will model typical cases of conservation data and will propose guidelines on best practices for encoding conservation documentation records based on the CIDOC-CRM. Conservation domain expertise and sample conservation data are needed. Please circulate this to conservation colleagues in your institution.\n\nRegistration is now open at [https://forms.gle/eh96yn5ogxQ6VNdF8](https://forms.gle/eh96yn5ogxQ6VNdF8). The deadline for registrations 16 August 2019.\n\nYou can follow the LCD project at: [https://www.ligatus.org.uk/lcd/](https://www.ligatus.org.uk/lcd/)\n\n",
