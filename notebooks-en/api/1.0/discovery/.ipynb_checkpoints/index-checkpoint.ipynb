    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked Art data does not exist in a vacuum, nor does it try to define all possible interactions with cultural heritage data. Instead, our scope is to define the semantic description of cultural heritage items, and the important surrounding contextual information such as people, places, concepts and events. This section documents how to reference Linked Art records from other APIs and web-based systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Visibility from HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to ensure that search engines such as Google get as much information as possible, there is a mapping from Linked Art into the [Schema.Org](https://schema.org/) structure. Schema.Org can be embedded within web pages as JSON-LD or other formats enabling search engines to process the data as data, rather than only via the human-intended HTML. The [mapping](/cookbook/mappings/schema/) is not part of the versioned APIs as it will be updated as the underlying schema and its usage changes, which is not in our control.\n",
    "\n",
    "For visibility of the data to clients that might be given a web page, rather than the URI of the JSON-LD record, it is also important to give them a link to the data. This is done via [Link Headers](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8288.html) in the HTTP response (for non-browser clients), and within the HTML `head` element (for browser-based clients). This will allow the client to go from the HTML view for human users directly to the more machine understandable JSON-LD records for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the HTTP response of the web page for the object, the header to link to the JSON-LD record would look like this:\n",

This is the purpose of the [IIIF Change Discovery API](https://iiif.io/api/discovery/). \n",
