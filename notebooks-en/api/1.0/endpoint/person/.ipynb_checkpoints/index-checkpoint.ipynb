    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Person API is a method of getting access to descriptions of people, living or dead.  This would include artists and collectors, but also museum staff such as curators or conservators that perform their professional activities on or using artwork. The Person model is of average complexity, with many familiar properties and patterns, plus a few more specific fields.  This results in an average complexity API that can result in reasonably long JSON responses if all of the fields have values. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the usage of Person data, please see the [Person model](/model/actor/) description.\n",
