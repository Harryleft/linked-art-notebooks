    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Set API is a method of getting access to descriptions of sets or collections of any sort of entity, including especially objects, texts and images.  The Set model is relatively simple with the common properties and patterns, and very few additions. It must be noted that, like the [Group API](../group/), the Set API does not list its members, to avoid the potential for very long lists. Instead the individual entities are members of the set, and discovering others is left to APIs to be determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the usage of Set data, please see the [Collection model](/model/collection/) description.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Property Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Dereferencing an entity via the Set endpoint would result in a JSON-LD document containing a single JSON object with the following properties.\n",

    "| `id`              | string        | Required    | The value MUST be the HTTP(S) URI at which the set's representation can be [dereferenced](../../protocol/) |  \n",

    "| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a human readable statement about the set and MUST follow the requirements for [Statement](../../shared/statement/) |\n",

    "| `representation`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a reference to a [Visual Work](../visual_work) that represents the current set, and MUST follow the requirements for a [reference](../../shared/reference/) |\n",
    "| `member_of`       | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a Set that the current set is a member of and MUST follow the requirements for a [reference](../../shared/reference/) to a Set |\n",
    "| `subject_of`      | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a reference to a [Textual Work](../textual_work/), the content of which focuses on the current set, and MUST follow the requirements for a [reference](../../shared/reference) |\n",
    "| `attributed_by`   | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a [Relationship Assignment](../../shared/assignment/) that relates the current set to another entity |\n",

    "| `about`           | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../../shared/reference) to another entity of any type, that this Set is primarily about or has as a subject |\n",
    "| `members_exemplified_by` | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which is either an embedded structure that follows the patterns of one of the Linked Art API endpoints, or a reference to any Linked Art resource | \n",
    "| `members_contained_by` | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which is a reference to a [Physical Object](../physical_object/) that holds or contains (physical) members of the current set | \n",

    "| `used_for`        | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which is a Publication (or similar activity) which follows the requirements for an [Activity](../../shared/activity) |\n",
