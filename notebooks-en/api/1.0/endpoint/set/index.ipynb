The Set model is relatively simple with the common properties and patterns, and very few additions. It must be noted that, like the [Group API](../group/), the Set API does not list its members, to avoid the potential for very long lists. Instead the individual entities are members of the set, and discovering others is left to APIs to be determined.\n\nFor more information about the usage of Set data, please see the [Collection model](/model/collection/) description.\n\n\n## Property Definitions\n\nDereferencing an entity via the Set endpoint would result in a JSON-LD document containing a single JSON object with the following properties.\n\n### Properties of Sets\n\n| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | \n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| `@context`        | string, array | Required    | The value MUST be the URI of the [Linked Art context](../../json-ld/) as a string, `\"https://linked.art/ns/v1/linked-art.json\"` or an array in which the URI is the last entry to allow for [extensions](../../json-ld/extensions) | \n| `id`              | string        | Required    | The value MUST be the HTTP(S) URI at which the set's representation can be [dereferenced](../../protocol/) |  \n| `type`            | string        | Required    | The class for the set, which MUST be the value `\"Set\"` |\n| `_label`          | string        | Recommended | A human readable label for the set, intended for developers |\n| `classified_as`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a classification of the set and MUST follow the requirements for [Type](../../shared/type/) |\n| `identified_by`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a name of the set and MUST follow the requirements for [Name](../../shared/name/), or an identifier for the set and MUST follow the requirements for [Identifier](../../shared/identifier/) |\n| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a human readable statement about the set and MUST follow the requirements for [Statement](../../shared/statement/) |\n| `equivalent`      | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../../shared/reference) to an external identity and description of the current set |\n| `representation`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a reference to a [Visual Work](../visual_work) that represents the current set, and MUST follow the requirements for a [reference](../../shared/reference/) |\n| `member_of`       | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a Set that the current set is a member of and MUST follow the requirements for a [reference](../../shared/reference/) to a Set |\n| `subject_of`      | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a reference to a [Textual Work](../textual_work/), the content of which focuses on the current set, and MUST follow the requirements for a [reference](../../shared/reference) |\n| `attributed_by`   | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a [Relationship Assignment](../../shared/assignment/) that relates the current set to another entity |\n| `dimension`       | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which is a [Dimension](../../shared/dimension), such as total number of members, of the current set |\n| `about`           | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../../shared/reference) to another entity of any type, that this Set is primarily about or has as a subject |\n| `members_exemplified_by` | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which is either an embedded structure that follows the patterns of one of the Linked Art API endpoints, or a reference to any Linked Art resource | \n| `members_contained_by` | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which is a reference to a [Physical Object](../physical_object/) that holds or contains (physical) members of the current set | \n| `created_by`      | json object | Optional | A json object representing the creation of the set, which follows the requirements for a [Creation](../../shared/activity) | \n| `used_for`        | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which is a Publication (or similar activity) which follows the requirements for an [Activity](../../shared/activity) |\n\n\n### Property Diagram\n\n> ![diagram](set_properties.png){:.diagram_img width=\"600px\"}\n\n### JSON Schema\n\nSee the [schema documentation](../../schema_docs/set) and the [schema itself](../../schema/set.json)\n\nNote that the `members_exemplified_by` property can only be minimally validated.\n\n\n### Incoming Properties\n\nSet instances are typically found as the object of the following properties, other than the self-referential properties above.  This list is not exhaustive, but is intended to cover the likely cases where other endpoints refer to sets.\n\n| Property Name              | Source Endpoint | Description |\n|----------------------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| `member_of`                | All             | Entities other than People or Groups can be members of sets. (People and Groups are members of Groups instead) |\n| `used_specific_object`     | [Event](../event/) | [Events](../event/) can use sets of things, for example the set of objects in an exhibition or auction lot |\n\n\n## Example\n\nThe JSON for a Set entry for the Met's Collection could be as below.\n\n* It has the Linked Art context document reference in `@context`\n* It self-documents its URI in `id`\n* It has a `type` of \"Set\"\n* It has a `_label` with the value \"Collection of the Met\" for people reading the JSON\n* It is `classified_as` a \"Collection\", which has an `id` of \"aat:300025976\"\n* It is `identified_by` a `Name`, with the content \"Art Collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\"\n* It is `referred_to_by` a statement which ...\n    * ... has `content` of \"Over 2 million works ...\"\n    * ... is `classified_as` a Description (\"aat:300435416\")\n* It was `created_by` a Creation which ...\n    * ... has a `timespan` between \"1870-04-13T00:00:00Z\" and \"1870-04-13T23:59:59Z\"\n\n\n",
