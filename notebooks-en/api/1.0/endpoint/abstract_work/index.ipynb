Examples are the \"idea\" behind an exhibition, the general concept of a piece of performance art rather than the activity which enacts that idea, or the most general form of a work without specifically being composed of image or language. Abstract works are thus not frequently used but are necessary to connect instances of the work, such as a travelling exhibition or different performances of the same idea.\n\nFor more information about the usage of Abstract Work, please see the [Exhibition Concept](/model/exhibition/) description.\n\n\n## Property Definitions\n\nDereferencing an entity via the Abstract Work endpoint would result in a JSON-LD document containing a single JSON object with the following properties.\n\n### Properties of Abstract Works\n\n| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | \n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| `@context`        | string, array | Required    | The value MUST be the URI of the [Linked Art context](../../json-ld/) as a string, `\"https://linked.art/ns/v1/linked-art.json\"` or an array in which the URI is the last entry to allow for [extensions](../../json-ld/extensions) | \n| `id`              | string        | Required    | The value MUST be the HTTP(S) URI at which the work's representation can be [dereferenced](../../protocol/) |  \n| `type`            | string        | Required    | The class for the work, which MUST be the value `\"PropositionalObject\"` |\n| `_label`          | string        | Recommended | A human readable label for the work, intended for developers |\n| `classified_as`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a classification of the work and MUST follow the requirements for [Type](../../shared/type/) |\n| `identified_by`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a name/title of the work and MUST follow the requirements for [Name](../../shared/name/), or an identifier for the work and MUST follow the requirements for [Identifier](../../shared/identifier/) |\n| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a human readable statement about the work and MUST follow the requirements for [Statement](../../shared/statement/) |\n| `equivalent`      | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../../shared/reference) to an external URI that also identifies the current work |\n| `subject_of`      | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a reference to a [Textual Work](../textual_work/), the content of which focuses on the current abstract work, and MUST follow the requirements for a [reference](../../shared/reference/) |\n| `representation`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a reference to a [Visual Work](../visual_work) that represents the current work, and MUST follow the requirements for a [reference](../../shared/reference/) |\n| `member_of`       | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a Set that the current work is a member of and MUST follow the requirements for a [reference](../../shared/reference/) to a Set |\n| `attributed_by`   | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a [Relationship Assignment](../../shared/assignment/) that relates the current work to another entity |\n| `dimension` | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which is an abstract [Dimension](../../shared/dimension) of the current work |\n| `conceptually_part_of` | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../../shared/reference/) to another Abstract Work that the current work is conceptually part of |\n| `about` | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../../shared/reference/) to another entity of any type, that this work is primarily about | \n| `subject_to` | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which is a [Right](../../shared/right) that is held over the intellectual work |\n| `created_by` | json object | Optional | A json object representing the creation of the work, which follows the requirements for a [Creation](../../shared/activity) | \n\n### Property Diagram\n\n> ![diagram](abstract_properties.png){:.diagram_img width=\"600px\"}\n\n### JSON Schema\n\nSee the [schema documentation](../../schema_docs/abstract) and the [schema itself](../../schema/abstract.json)\n\n\n### Incoming Properties\n\nAbstract Work instances are typically found as the object of the following properties, other than the self-referential properties above.  This list is not exhaustive, but is intended to cover the likely cases where other endpoints refer to texts.\n\n| Property Name              | Source Endpoint | Description |\n|----------------------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| `about`                    | Textual Work    | Textual works can be about abstract works  |\n| `influenced_by`             | Activity        | Activities (such as Exhibitions) can be influenced by the abstract work |\n  \n\n## Example\n\nThe JSON for an Abstract Work entry for the idea for an exhibition about Gainsborough could be as below.\n\n* It has the Linked Art context document reference in `@context`\n* It self-documents its URI in `id`\n* It has a `type` of \"PropositionalObject\"\n* It has a `_label` with the value \"Gainsborough Exh.\" for people reading the JSON\n* It is `classified_as` an Exhibition, which has an `id` of \"aat:300417531\"\n* It is `identified_by` ...\n    * ... a `Name`, with the content \"Gainsborough Exhibition\"\n* It is `referred_to_by` a statement which ...\n    * ... has `content` describing the abstract work\n    * ... and is `classified_as` an abstract (\"aat:300418049\")\n* It is `about` Gainsborough, a Person with `id` \"ulan:500115200\"\n* It was `created_by` a Creation which ...\n    * ... was `carried_out_by` Brett Hayes, a Person\n\n\n",
