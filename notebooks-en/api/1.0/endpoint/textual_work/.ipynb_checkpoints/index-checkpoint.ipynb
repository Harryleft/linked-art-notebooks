    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Textual Work API is a method of getting access to descriptions of texts, such as the linguistic content carried in printed or digital books, linguistic content incorporated as part of artworks, or other noteworthy linguistic content.  The Textual Work model is of average complexity with many familiar properties and patterns, plus several additions to describe the text's relationship to other entities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the usage of Textual Work data, please see the [Document model](/model/document/) description.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Property Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Dereferencing an entity via the Textual Work endpoint would result in a JSON-LD document containing a single JSON object with the following properties.\n",
