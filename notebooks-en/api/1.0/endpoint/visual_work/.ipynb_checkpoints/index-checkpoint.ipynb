    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Visual Work API is a method of getting access to descriptions of image content, such as the appearance of paintings and two-dimensional artworks, sculptures and three-dimensional artworks, or digital images.  The Visual Work model is of average complexity with many familiar properties and patterns, plus several additions to describe the visual work's relationship to other entities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the usage of Visual Work data, please see the [Object Aboutness model](/model/object/aboutness/) description.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Property Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Dereferencing an entity via the Visual Work endpoint would result in a JSON-LD document containing a single JSON object with the following properties.\n",
