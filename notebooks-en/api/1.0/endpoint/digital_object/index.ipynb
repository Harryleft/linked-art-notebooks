Access to the digital content itself, when it is available online, is provided through the `access_point` property within the description. The Digital Object API is of average complexity with many familiar properties and patterns, plus several additions to describe the object's relationship to other entities.  \n\nFor more information about the usage of Digital Object records, please see the [Digital model](/model/digital/) description.\n\n## Property Definitions\n\nDereferencing an entity via the Digital Object endpoint would result in a JSON-LD document containing a single JSON object with the following properties.\n\n### Properties of Digital Objects\n\n| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | \n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| `@context`        | string, array | Required    | The value MUST be the URI of the [Linked Art context](../../json-ld/) as a string, `\"https://linked.art/ns/v1/linked-art.json\"` or an array in which the URI is the last entry to allow for [extensions](../../json-ld/extensions) | \n| `id`              | string        | Required    | The value MUST be the HTTP(S) URI at which the digital object's description can be [dereferenced](../../protocol/) |  \n| `type`            | string        | Required    | The class for the digital object, which MUST be the value `\"DigitalObject\"` |\n| `_label`          | string        | Recommended | A human readable label for the digital object, intended for developers |\n| `classified_as`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a classification of the digital object and MUST follow the requirements for [Type](../../shared/type/) |\n| `identified_by`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a name/title of the digital and MUST follow the requirements for [Name](../../shared/name/), or an identifier for the digital object and MUST follow the requirements for [Identifier](../../shared/identifier/) |\n| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a human readable statement about the digital object and MUST follow the requirements for [Statement](../../shared/statement/) |\n| `equivalent`      | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../../shared/reference) to an external identity of the current digital object |\n| `member_of`       | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a Set that the current digital object is a member of and MUST follow the requirements for a [reference](../../shared/reference/) to a Set |\n| `subject_of`      | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a reference to a [Textual Work](../textual_work/), the content of which focuses on the current object, and MUST follow the requirements for an [reference](../../shared/reference/) |\n| `representation`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a reference to a [Visual Work](../visual_work) that represents the current object, and MUST follow the requirements for an [reference](../../shared/reference/) |\n| `attributed_by`   | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a [Relationship Assignment](../../shared/assignment/) that relates the current digital object to another entity |\n| `dimension` | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which is a [Dimension](../../shared/dimension), such as height, width or total number of bytes, of the described digital object |\n| `part_of` | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../../shared/reference/) to another Digital Object that the current digital object is a part of. |\n| `format` | string | Optional | The media type of the described digital object, for example \"image/jpeg\" |\n| `conforms_to` | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../../shared/reference/) to an external specification that the current digital object conforms to.
