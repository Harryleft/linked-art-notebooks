    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Digital Object API is a method of getting access to **descriptions of** digital content, such as images, documents or other electronic media, regardless of whether that file is accessible over the network at all. Access to the digital content itself, when it is available online, is provided through the `access_point` property within the description. The Digital Object API is of average complexity with many familiar properties and patterns, plus several additions to describe the object's relationship to other entities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the usage of Digital Object records, please see the [Digital model](/model/digital/) description.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Property Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Dereferencing an entity via the Digital Object endpoint would result in a JSON-LD document containing a single JSON object with the following properties.\n",
