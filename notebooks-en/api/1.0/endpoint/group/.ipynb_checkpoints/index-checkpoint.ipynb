    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Group API is a method of getting access to descriptions of sets of people and/or subgroups, such as families, organizations, companies, departments or any other identifiable set of actors.  The Group model is of average complexity with many familiar properties and patterns, plus a few more specific fields.  This results in an average complexity API, which is very similar to the [Person API](../person/), that can result in reasonably long JSON responses if all of the fields have values. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the usage of Group data, please see the [Group model](/model/actor/) description.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Property Definitions\n",
