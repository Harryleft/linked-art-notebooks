The Group model is of average complexity with many familiar properties and patterns, plus a few more specific fields.  This results in an average complexity API, which is very similar to the [Person API](../person/), that can result in reasonably long JSON responses if all of the fields have values. \n\nFor more information about the usage of Group data, please see the [Group model](/model/actor/) description.\n\n\n## Property Definitions\n\nDereferencing an entity via the Group endpoint would result in a JSON-LD document containing a single JSON object with the following properties.\n\n### Properties of Groups\n\n| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | \n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| `@context`        | string, array | Required    | The value MUST be the URI of the [Linked Art context](../../json-ld/) as a string, `\"https://linked.art/ns/v1/linked-art.json\"` or an array in which the URI is the last entry to allow for [extensions](../../json-ld/extensions) | \n| `id`              | string        | Required    | The value MUST be the HTTP(S) URI at which the group's representation can be [dereferenced](../../protocol/) |  \n| `type`            | string        | Required    | The class for the group, which MUST be the value `\"Group\"` |\n| `_label`          | string        | Recommended | A human readable label for the group, intended for developers |\n| `classified_as`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a classification of the group and MUST follow the requirements for [Type](../../shared/type/) |\n| `identified_by`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a name of the group and MUST follow the requirements for [Name](../../shared/name/), or an identifier for the group and MUST follow the requirements for [Identifier](../../shared/identifier/) |\n| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a human readable statement about the group and MUST follow the requirements for [Statement](../../shared/statement/) |\n| `equivalent`      | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../../shared/reference) to an external identity and description of the current group |\n| `representation`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a reference to a [Visual Work](../visual_work) that represents the current group, and MUST follow the requirements for a [reference](../../shared/reference/) |\n| `member_of`       | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a Group that the current group is a member of and MUST follow the requirements for a [reference](../../shared/reference/) to a **[Group](../group/)** |\n| `subject_of`      | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a reference to a [Textual Work](../textual_work/), the content of which focuses on the current group, and MUST follow the requirements for a [reference](../../shared/reference) |\n| `attributed_by`   | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a [Relationship Assignment](../../shared/assignment/) that relates the current group to another entity |\n| `contact_point` | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which is an address at which the group is reachable and MUST follow the requirements for an [Identifier](../../shared/identifier) |\n| `residence` | array | Optional | A place that the group was associated with, and MUST follow the requirements for a [reference](../../shared/reference/) to a [Place](../place/) |\n| `carried_out` | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which represents professional activities of the group and follows the requirements for [Activities](../../shared/activity) |\n| `participated_in` | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which represents an activity or event in which the group participated, but was not responsible, and follows the requirements for [Activities](../../shared/activity) |\n| `formed_by` | json object | Optional | A json object representing the formation of the group, which follows the requirements for a [Formation](../../shared/activity) | \n| `dissolved_by` | json object | Optional | A json object representing the dissolution of the group, which follows the requirements for a [Dissolution](../../shared/activity) |\n\n### Property Diagram\n\n> ![diagram](group_properties.png){:.diagram_img width=\"600px\"}\n\n### JSON Schema\n\nSee the [schema documentation](../../schema_docs/group) and the [schema itself](../../schema/group.json)\n\n\n### Incoming Properties\n\nGroup instances are typically found as the object of the following properties, other than the self-referential properties above.  This list is not exhaustive, but is intended to cover the likely cases where other endpoints refer to groups.\n\n| Property Name              | Source Endpoint | Description |\n|----------------------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| `member_of`                | [Person](../person/), [Group](../group/)   | People that are members of the current Group are recorded in the Person record |\n| `carried_out_by`           | All             | An activity that the Group carried out |\n| `current_owner`            | [Object](../physical_object/) | An object owned by the Group |\n| `current_custodian`        | [Object](../physical_object/) | An object in the custody of the Group |\n| `current_permanent_custodian` | [Object](../physical_object/) | An object that is normally in the custody of the Group |\n| `represents`               | [Visual Work](../visual_work/)     | Image content which represents the Group (the inverse of `representation`) |\n| `about`                    | [Textual Work](../textual_work/)    | Textual content that is about the Group |\n| `transferred_custody_to`   | [Provenance](../provenance_activity/)     | The activity of transferring custody of an object to the Group |\n| `transferred_custody_from` | [Provenance](../provenance_activity/)     | The activity of transferring custody of an object away from the Group |\n| `transferred_title_to`     | [Provenance](../provenance_activity/)     | The activity of transferring ownership of an object to the Group |\n| `transferred_title_from`   | [Provenance](../provenance_activity/)     | The activity of transferring ownership of an object away from the Group |\n| `paid_to`                  | [Provenance](../provenance_activity/)     | The activity of paying money to the Group from someone else |\n| `paid_from`                | [Provenance](../provenance_activity/)    | The activity of paying money from the Group to someone else |\n\n\n## Example\n\nThe JSON for a Group entry for the Camden Town Group could be as below.\n\n* It has the Linked Art context document reference in `@context`\n* It self-documents its URI in `id`\n* It has a `type` of \"Group\"\n* It has a `_label` with the value \"Camden Town Group\" for people reading the JSON\n* It is `classified_as` ...\n    * ... a \"Society\", which has an `id` of \"aat:300026009\"\n    * ... \"British\", which as an `id` of \"aat:300111159\" and a meta-type of \"Nationality\", which has an `id` of \"aat:300379842\"\n* It is `identified_by` a `Name`, with the content \"Camden Town Group\", and `language` of English (\"aat:300388277\")\n* It is `referred_to_by` a statement which ...\n    * ... has `content` of \"A group of British painters formed in 1911 ...\"\n    * ... is `classified_as` a Biography (\"aat:300435422\")\n* It `carried_out` its professional activities ...\n    * ... in a `timespan` between \"1911-01-01\" and \"1913-12-31\"\n* It is `attributed_by` an \"AttributeAssignment\" relationship\n    * ... to the London Group, with `id` \"ulan:500117319\"\n* It has a `residence` of London\n* It is `equivalent` to the ULAN entry `\"ulan:500117318\"\n* It was `formed_by` a Formation which ...\n    * ... `took_place_at` London\n    * ... in a `timespan` between \"1911-01-01\" and \"1911-12-31\"\n* It was `dissolved_by` a Dissolution which ...\n    * ... `took_place_at` London again\n    * ... in a `timespan` between \"1913-01-01\" and \"1913-12-31\"  \n\n",
