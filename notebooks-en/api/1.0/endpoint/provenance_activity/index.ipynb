The API is of higher than average complexity with many familiar properties and patterns, but also with a series of classes which convey parts of the higher level activity, each with their own unique properties.\n\n## Property Definitions\n\nDereferencing an entity via the Provenance Activity endpoint would result in a JSON-LD document containing a single JSON object with the following
