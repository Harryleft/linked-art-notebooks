    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Concept API is a method of getting access to descriptions of concepts, including Types, Materials, Languages, MeasurementUnits and Currencies. The Concept model is relatively simple with the common properties and patterns, and very few additions. This API endpoint is for full records that describe concepts, rather than references to concepts within other records. For the embedded concept structure, please see the [Type Structure](../../shared/type) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Property Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Dereferencing an entity via the Concept endpoint would result in a JSON-LD document containing a single JSON object with the following properties.\n",
