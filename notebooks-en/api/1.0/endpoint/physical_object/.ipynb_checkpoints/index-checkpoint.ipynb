    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Physical Object API is a method of getting access to descriptions of physical objects, such as paintings, sculptures, manuscripts or other tangible artworks. The physical objects that carry the artwork content are a core part of any Linked Art information system, and thus the descriptions are likely to have a substantial amount of fields and data. This results in a relatively long set of relationships and properties, but they follow the typical patterns and constructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the Physical Object data, please see the [Object model](/model/object/) description.\n",
