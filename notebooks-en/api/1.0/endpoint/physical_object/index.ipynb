The physical objects that carry the artwork content are a core part of any Linked Art information system, and thus the descriptions are likely to have a substantial amount of fields and data. This results in a relatively long set of relationships and properties, but they follow the typical patterns and constructions.\n\nFor more information about the Physical Object data, please see the [Object model](/model/object/) description.\n\n\n### Properties of Physical Objects\n\n\n| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description |
