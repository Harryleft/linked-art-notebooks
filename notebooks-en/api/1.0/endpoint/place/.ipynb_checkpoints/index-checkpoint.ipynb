    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Places are a foundational aspect of the Linked Art model for providing context as to where activities occur. They are extents in space described by a geometry, and independent of time or what object(s) may be present at the location. Places are a relatively simple model and therefore a relatively simple API, using the shared features and common patterns, along with a WKT based definition of the geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the usage of Places, please see the [Place model](/model/place/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Property Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Dereferencing an entity via the Place endpoint would result in a JSON-LD document containing a JSON object with the following properties.\n",
