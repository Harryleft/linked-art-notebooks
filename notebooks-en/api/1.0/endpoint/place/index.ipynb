They are extents in space described by a geometry, and independent of time or what object(s) may be present at the location. Places are a relatively simple model and therefore a relatively simple API, using the shared features and common patterns, along with a WKT based definition of the geometry.\n\nFor more information about the usage of Places, please see the [Place model](/model/place/).\n\n## Property Definitions\n\nDereferencing an entity via the Place endpoint would result in a JSON-LD document containing a JSON object with the following properties.\n\n### Properties of Places\n\n| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | \n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| `@context`        | string, array | Required    | The value MUST be the URI of the [Linked Art context](../../json-ld/) as a string, `\"https://linked.art/ns/v1/linked-art.json\"` or an array in which the URI is the last entry to allow for [extensions](../../json-ld/extensions) | \n| `id`              | string        | Required    | The value MUST be the HTTP(S) URI at which the place's representation can be [dereferenced](../../protocol/) |  \n| `type`            | string        | Required    | The class for the place, which MUST be the value `\"Place\"` |\n| `_label`          | string        | Recommended | A human readable label for the place, intended for developers |\n| `classified_as`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a classification of the Place and MUST follow the requirements for [Type](../../shared/type/) |\n| `identified_by`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a name of the Place and MUST follow the requirements for [Name](../../shared/name/), or an identifier for the Place and MUST follow the requirements for [Identifier](../../shared/identifier/) |\n| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a human readable statement about the Place and MUST follow the requirements for [Statement](../../shared/statement/) |\n| `equivalent`      | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../../shared/reference) to an external identity and description of the current Place |\n| `representation`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a reference to a [Visual Work](../visual_work) that represents the current Place, and MUST follow the requirements for a [reference](../../shared/reference/) |\n| `member_of`       | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a reference to a [Set](../set/) that the current Place is a member of and MUST follow the requirements for a [reference](../../shared/reference/) |\n| `subject_of`      | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a reference to a [Textual Work](../textual_work/), the content of which focuses on the current Place, and MUST follow the requirements for a [reference](../../shared/reference) |\n| `attributed_by`   | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a [Relationship Assignment](../../shared/assignment/) that relates the current Place to another entity |\n| `part_of`         | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a Place that the current Place falls within and MUST follow the requirements for a [reference](../../shared/reference/) to a Place |\n| `defined_by`      | string        | Optional    | A string containing the [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) representation of the geometry of the Place |\n\n\n### Property Diagram\n\n> ![diagram](place_properties.png){:.diagram_img width=\"600px\"}\n\n### JSON Schema\n\nSee the [schema documentation](../../schema_docs/place) and the [schema itself](../../schema/place.json)\n\n\n### Incoming Properties\n\nPlace instances are typically found as the object of the following properties, other than the self-referential properties above.  This list is not exhaustive, but is intended to cover the likely cases where other endpoints refer to places.\n\n| Property Name      | Source Endpoint | Description |\n|--------------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| `took_place_at`    | All | All Events and Activities can take place at a Place, which appear in most of the endpoints such as the location of the birth of a person, or the location of the assignment of an identifier  |\n| `current_location` | [Object](../physical_object/) | The current location of an object is recorded in the object API |\n| `current_permanent_location` | [Physical Object](../physical_object/) | The normal location of the object is also recorded in the object API |\n| `moved_from`       | [Provenance](../provenance_activity/) | In Provenance Activities, objects can be moved in a `Move` activity from one place ...| \n| `moved_to`         | [Provenance](../provenance_activity/) | ... to another place |\n| `residence`        | [Person](../person/), [Group](../group/) | People and Groups have Places at which they are, or have been, resident |\n\n\n## Example\n\nThe JSON for a Place entry for the city of Los Angeles could be as below.\n\n* It has the Linked Art context document reference in `@context`\n* It self-documents its URI in `id`\n* It has a `type` of \"Place\"\n* It has a `_label` with the value \"Los Angeles\" for humans reading the JSON\n* It is `classified_as` a city, which has an `id` of _aat:300008389_, a `type` of Type, and a label. \n* It is `identified_by` a `Name`, with the `content` \"Los Angeles\"\n* It is `identified_by` an `Identifier`, with the `content` \"06-44000\"\n* It is `defined_by` a particular WKT Polygon\n* It is `referred_to_by` a `LinguisticObject`, which is `classified_as` a Description (_aat:300435416_), and has `content` of \"Los Angeles is the largest city in California\"\n* It is `part_of` another `Place`, which is the state California\n* It is a `member_of` the `Set` of top 10 cities in the USA\n* It is equivalent to the TGN entry \n\n\n",
