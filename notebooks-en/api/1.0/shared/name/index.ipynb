If there is an `id` property with a URI, and there is more information about the name available from the representation at that URI, then `_complete` MUST be present with a value of `false` to inform the consuming application that it might want to retrieve it |\n| `content`         | string        | Required    | The string form of the Name | <!-- LAF.6 -->\n| `classified_as`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a further classification of the name and MUST follow the requirements for [Type](../type/) | <!-- LAF.5 -->\n| `language`        | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a language present in the content of the name and MUST follow the requirements for [Language](../type/)| <!-- LAF.7 -->\n| `part`            | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a part of the current name, and MUST follow these requirements for Names| <!-- -->\n| `identified_by`   | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a name for this Name and follows the Name pattern |\n| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is either a reference to a [textual work](../../endpoint/textual_work/) that refers to the name, or an embedded [statement](../statement/) about the Name. | <!-- -->\n| `assigned_by`     | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is an assignment of the Name, and MUST follow the requirements for [Assignments](../assignment/) |\n\n### Property Diagram\n\n> ![diagram](name_properties.png){:.diagram_img width=\"600px\"}\n\n\n### Incoming Properties\n\nName instances are typically found as the object of the following properties.  This list is not exhaustive, but is intended to cover the likely cases.\n\n| Property Name   | Source Class      | Description |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| `identified_by` | All               | Names are used to provide an identifying label to the entity via identified_by. |\n\n(And that's all!)\n\n## Example\n\nAn object is given the name \"Hacha (Ceremonial Axe)\", with a note that the original form was 'hacha'.\n\n* It has a URI given in `id` (that identifies the Name itself, not the object)\n* It has a `type` of \"Name\"\n* It is `classified_as` a primary name, with `id` of _aat:300404670_ and a `type` of \"Type\"\n* It has `content` of \"Hacha (Ceremonial Axe)\"\n* It has a display label of \"Assigned Title\"\n* It is `referred_to_by` a statement, with a `type` of \"LinguisticObject\", `classified_as` a note with `id` of _aat:300027200_ and with `content` of \"Title was originally ...\"\n* It has languages of English, with an `id` of _aat:300388277_ and `type` of \"Language\", and Spanish, with an `id` of _aat:300389311_ and `type` of \"Language\"\n* It has a specific `part`, which ...\n    * ... also has a `type` of \"Name\"\n    * ... is `classified_as` a subtitle, with an `id` of _aat:300312006_\n    * ... has `content` of \"Ceremonial Axe\"\n    * ... and a language of English, as above. \n\n",
