All of the different types of entity can have identifiers assigned to them.  Identifiers are very similar in structure to [Names](../name/), but are explicitly not part of natural langauge, and hence do not have a `language` property, nor can they be translated or have alternative forms and hence are documented separately.\n\nIdentifiers are described in the [base patterns](/model/base/#types-and-classifications) of the model documentation, and examples are present for practically every class.\n\n## Property Definitions\n\nIdentifiers have the following properties.\n\n### Properties of Identifiers\n\n| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | \n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------| \n| `id`              | string        | Optional    | If present, the value MUST be a URI identifying the identifier, from which a representation of the assignment can be retrieved | \n| `type`            | string        | Required    | The class for the name, which MUST be the value `\"Identifier\"` |\n| `_label`          | string        | Recommended | A human readable label, intended for developers | \n| `_complete`       | boolean       | Optional    | Non-Semantic. If there is an `id` property with a URI, and there is more information about the identifier available from the representation at that URI, then `_complete` MUST be present with a value of `false` to inform the consuming application that it might want to retrieve it |\n| `content`         | string        | Required    | The string content of the identifier | \n| `classified_as`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a further classification of the identifier and MUST follow the requirements for [Type](../type/) | \n| `identified_by`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a name to be displayed for the identifier, and MUST follow the requirements for [Name](../name/) |\n| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is either a [reference](../reference/) to a [textual work](../../endpoint/textual_work/) that refers to the identifier, or an embedded [statement](../statement/) about the identifier. |\n| `assigned_by`     | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is an assignment of the identifier, and MUST follow the requirements for [Assignments](../assignment/) |\n\n### Property Diagram\n\n> ![diagram](identifier_properties.png){:.diagram_img width=\"600px\"}\n\n\n### Incoming Properties\n\nIdentifier instances are typically found as the object of the following properties.  This list is not exhaustive, but is intended to cover the likely cases.\n\n| Property Name   | Source Endpoint   | Description |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| `identified_by` | All               | The most common case is for a resource to be identified_by an Identifier, which can be found in every endpoint |\n| `contact_point` | [Person](../../endpoint/person/), [Group](../../endpoint/group/) | People and Groups can also have contact points, which are modeled as Identifiers. |\n\n## Example\n\nAn accession number for an object, created and assigned by Example Museum at some point during 1997.\n\n* It has a URI given in `id` (which identifies the Identifier, not the Object)\n* It has a `type` of \"Identifier\"\n* It has a human readable `_label` of \"Example Museum Accession Number\" to explain what it is\n* It is `classified_as` an accession number, with an `id` of _aat:300312355_ and a `type` of Type\n* It is `referred_to_by` a statement, with a `type` of \"LinguisticObject\" and `content` of \"This is the original...\". The LinguisticObject is `classified_as` a note, with an `id` of _aat:300418049_ and `type` of Type\n* It has `content` of the value \"1997-A1752\"\n* It was `assigned_by` an identifier assignment, which ...\n    * ... has a URI given in `id` (which identifies the assignment)\n    * ... has a `type` of \"AttributeAssignment\"\n    * ... has a `timespan` structure, with a `begin_of_the_begin` date of Jan 1 1997 and an `end_of_the_end` date of Dec 31 1997\n    * ... was `carried_out_by` a [reference](../reference/) to the organization that created the identifer, with a `type` of \"Group\"\n\n",
