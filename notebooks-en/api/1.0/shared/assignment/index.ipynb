In order to manage such arbitrary, non-semantic relationships, the AttributeAssignment activity is used to convey this relationship, with the optional `assigned_property` to give the relationship type if known. \n\n## Property Definitions\n\nThe relationship assignment data structure has the following properties.\n\n### Properties of Assignments\n\n| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | \n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------| \n| `id`              | string        | Optional    | If present, the value MUST be a URI identifying the assignment, from which a representation of the assignment can be retrieved |  \n| `type`            | string        | Required    | The class for the assignment, which MUST be the value `\"AttributeAssignment\"` |\n| `_label`          | string        | Recommended | A human readable label for the assignment, intended for developers |\n| `_complete`       | boolean       | Optional    | Non-Semantic. If there is an `id` property with a URI, and there is more information about the attribute assignment available from the representation at that URI, then `_complete` MUST be present with a value of `false` to inform the consuming application that it might want to retrieve it |\n| `identified_by`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a name of the assignment and MUST follow the requirements for [Name](../../shared/name/), or an identifier for the assignment and MUST follow the requirements for [Identifier](../../shared/identifier/)|\n| `classified_as`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a further classification of the assignment and MUST follow the requirements for [Type](../type/) |\n| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is an embedded [statement](../statement/) about the assignment |\n| `carried_out_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../reference/) to a [Person](../../endpoint/person) or [Group](../../endpoint/group) which made the assignment|\n| `timespan`        | json object   | Optional    | A json object which describes when the relationship was assigned, and MUST follow the requirements for [timespans](../timespan/)|\n| `during`          | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../../shared/reference) to a [Period](../event/) during which the Assignment occured |\n| `before`          | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../../shared/reference) to a Period, Event or Activity before which this Assignment occured |\n| `after`          | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../../shared/reference) to a Period, Event or Activity after which this Assignment occured |\n| `influenced_by`    | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../reference/) to another entity which influenced or motivated the assignment |\n| `caused_by`       | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../../shared/reference/) to an [Event](../event/) that caused the assignment to occur |\n| `used_specific_object` | array    | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../reference/) to another endpoint that was instrumental in the assignment |\n| `technique` | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which is a technique used in the assignment and MUST follow the requirements for [Type](../../shared/type) |\n| `assigned`        | array         | Required    | An array of json objects, each of which is a [reference](../reference/) to another entity that is related to the current one (SHOULD NOT be used with Dimension or Identifier assignments) |\n| `assigned_property` | string      | Optional    | A string which is either a URI, or resolves to a URI via a context document, for the specific relationship between the main entity and the entity referenced in `assigned` |\n\n\n### Property Diagram\n\n> ![diagram](assignment_properties.png){:.diagram_img width=\"600px\"}\n\n### Incoming Properties\n\nRelationship Assignment instances are typically found as the object of the following properties.  This list is not exhaustive, but is intended to cover the likely cases.\n\n| Property Name   | Source Endpoint   | Description |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| `attributed_by` | All Endpoints     | A list of Relationship Assignments for the entity |\n| `assigned_by`   | Dimension, Identifer | The activity of assigning the dimension or identifier to the entity |\n\n\n## Example\n\nA Human-Made Object [instance](../../endpoint/physical_thing/):\n\n",
