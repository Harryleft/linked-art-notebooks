The amount is a particular instance of a value/currency combination, so there can be multiple amounts each of which have the same value and currency, but are used in different models.  This is the same as the way there can be multiple dimensions with the same classification, value and unit used in different models.\n\nIn the Linked Art API and model, amounts are only used in the [Provenance Activity](../../endpoint/provenance_activity/) structure, as described in the [Provenance](/model/provenance/) model documentation.\n\n## Property Definitions\n\nThe monetary amount data structure has the following properties.\n\n### Properties of Monetary Amounts\n\n| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | \n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------| \n| `id`              | string        | Optional    | If present, the value MUST be a URI identifying the amount, from which a representation of the amount can be retrieved | \n| `type`            | string        | Required    | The class for the name, which MUST be the value `\"MonetaryAmount\"` |\n| `_label`          | string        | Recommended | A human readable label, intended for developers |\n| `_complete`       | boolean       | Optional    | Non-Semantic. If there is an `id` property with a URI, and there is more information about the amount available from the representation at that URI, then `_complete` MUST be present with a value of `false` to inform the consuming application that it might want to retrieve it |\n| `value`           | number        | Required    | The numeric value of the amount |\n| `currency`        | json object   | Required    | The currency for the amount, which MUST follow the requirements for a [Currency](../type/) |\n| `classified_as`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a further classification of the amount and MUST follow the requirements for [Type](../type/) |\n| `identified_by`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a textual representation of the structured data in the amount, and MUST follow the requirements for [Name](../name/) |\n| `upper_value_limit` | number      | Optional    | A number, which represents the highest possible value for the amount|\n| `lower_value_limit` | number      | Optional    | A number, which represents the lowest possible value for the amount |\n| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is either a [reference](../reference/) to a [textual work](../../endpoint/textual_work/) that refers to the amount, or an embedded [statement](../statement/) about the amount. |\n\n### Property Diagram\n\n> ![diagram](monetary_amount_properties.png){:.diagram_img width=\"600px\"}\n\n### Incoming Properties\n\nDimension instances are typically found as the object of the following properties.  This list is not exhaustive, but is intended to cover the likely cases.\n\n| Property Name   | Source Endpoint   | Description |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| `paid_amount`   | [Provenance Activity](../../endpoint/provenance_activity/) | Monetary amounts are mostly used to record the amount of money that changes hands in a transaction, referred to from a Payment in a Provenance Activity | \n| `dimension`     | [Set](../../endpoint/set/)      | Monetary amounts can be associated with other entities, such as a Set of objects, with the dimension property  |\n\n\n## Example\n\nAn auction lot has a monetary amount of $500 as its starting price.\n\n* It has a `type` of \"MonetaryAmount\"\n* It is `classified_as` a starting price, with an `id` of _aat:300417242_ and a `type` of \"Type\"\n* It has a `value` of 500\n* And a `currency` of US dollars, with an `id` of _aat:300411994_ and a `type` of \"Currency\"\n* It has a display label with the content of \"500 US Dollars\"\n* It is `referred_to_by` a note, with the content \"From personal correspondence\"\n\n",
