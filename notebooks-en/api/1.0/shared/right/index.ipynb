The URI for the class of Right is conveyed in `classified_as`.\n\nSee the model documentation for [rights](/model/object/rights/#rights-assertions).\n\n## Property Definitions\n\nThe rights data structure has the following properties.\n\n### Properties of Rights\n\n| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | \n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| `id`              | string        | Optional    | If present, the value MUST be a URI identifying the right description, from which a representation of it can be retrieved | \n| `type`            | string        | Required    | The class for the right, which MUST be the value `\"Right\"` |\n| `_label`          | string        | Recommended | A human readable label, intended for developers |\n| `_complete`       | boolean       | Optional    | Non-Semantic. If there is an `id` property with a URI, and there is more information about the identifier available from the representation at that URI, then `_complete` MUST be present with a value of `false` to inform the consuming application that it might want to retrieve it |\n| `identified_by`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a name for the right, and MUST follow the requirements for [Name](../name/) |\n| `classified_as`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a further classification of the right and MUST follow the requirements for [Type](../type/) |\n| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is an embedded [statement](../statement/) about the right |\n| `possessed_by`    | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is a reference to a [Person](../../endpoint/person) or [Group](../../endpoint/group) that holds the right |\n\n### Property Diagram\n\n> ![diagram](right_properties.png){:.diagram_img width=\"600px\"}\n\n### Incoming Properties\n\nRight instances are typically found as the object of the following properties.\n\n| Property Name   | Source Endpoint   | Description |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| `subject_to`     | [Textual Work](../../endpoint/textual_work/), [Visual Work](../../endpoint/visual_work), [Abstract Work](../../endpoint/abstract_work), [Statement](../statement/) | Intellectual things, primarily works, can have rights associated with them using the `subject_to` property |\n\n## Example\n\nA textual work is in the public domain.\n\n* The Textual Work is `subject_to` the Right\n* The Right itself does not have a URI, but has a `type` of `Right`\n* It is `classified_as` the sort of Right, in this case the Creative Commons URI for CC Zero\n* It is `identified_by` a `Name`, which is `classified_as` being a Display Title, and the `content` of \"Public Domain\"\n\n",
