Even if there are structured forms of the resources, these textual descriptions are useful to render to end users. They can have both internationalized `content`, as well as internationalized labels in the form of `Name` instances associated with them.  These statements are embedded within the resource being described, rather than separate long form texts.\n\nStatements are described in the [base patterns](/model/base/) of the model documentation, and examples are present for practically every class.\n\n## Property Definitions\n\n### Properties of Names\n\n| Property Name     | Datatype      | Requirement | Description | \n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------| \n| `id`              | string        | Optional    | If present, the value MUST be a URI identifying the statement, from which a representation of the statement can be retrieved | \n| `type`            | string        | Required    | The class for the statement, which MUST be the value `\"LinguisticObject\"` |\n| `_label`          | string        | Optional    | A human readable label, intended for developers |\n| `_complete`       | boolean       | Optional    | Non-Semantic. If there is an `id` property with a URI, and there is more information about the statement available from the representation at that URI, then `_complete` MUST be present with a value of `false` to inform the consuming application that it might want to retrieve it |\n| `content`         | string        | Required    | The string value of the statement |\n| `classified_as`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a further classification of the statement and MUST follow the requirements for [Type](../type/) |\n| `language`        | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a language present in the content of the statement and MUST follow the requirements for [Language](../type/)|\n| `identified_by`   | array         | Recommended | An array of json objects, each of which is a label or name for the statement, and MUST follow the requirements for [Name](../name/) |\n| `referred_to_by`  | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is either a reference to a [textual work](../../endpoint/textual_work/) that refers to this statement, or an embedded statement about this statement | \n| `format`          | string        | Optional    | If the string in content is not plain text, then format can be used to specify the media type of the string |\n| `assigned_by`     | array         | Optional    | An array of json objects, each of which is an assignment of the statement, and MUST follow the requirements for [Assignments](../assignment/) |\n| `subject_to` | array | Optional | An array of json objects, each of which is a [Right](../right) that is held over the statement |\n| `created_by` | json object | Optional | A json object representing the creation of the statement, which follows the requirements for a [Creation](../../shared/activity) |\n\n\n### Property Diagram\n\n> ![diagram](statement_properties.png){:.diagram_img width=\"600px\"}\n\n### Incoming Properties\n\nStatements are typically found as the object of the following properties.  This list is not exhaustive, but is intended to cover the most likely cases.\n\n| Property Name    | Source Endpoint  | Description |\n|------------------|------------------|-------------|\n| `referred_to_by` | All              | Statements are almost always found in the `referred_to_by` property, and can be present in any of the API endpoints |\n\n\n## Example\n\nAn object is `referred_to_by` a Description in English.\n\n* The description has a `type` of \"LinguisticObject\"\n* It is `classified_as` a description, with an `id` of _aat:300435416_ and `type` of \"Type\".  The description concept is in turn `classified_as` a type of \"brief text\"\n* It has `content` of \"A small greenstone pendant...\"\n* It is `identified_by` a display label, which has a `type` of \"Name\", and `content` of \"Description\"\n* It has a `language` of English, which has an `id` of _aat:300388277_\n* It has a statement about the description, saying that it was provided by the artist.\n* It is `subject_to` a Right, which is Creative Commons Attribution Required, version 4.0\n\n",
