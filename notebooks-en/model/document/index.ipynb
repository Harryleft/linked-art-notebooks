This model is intended to be enough to use for the basic use cases of referencing texts that are related to artworks, regardless of whether they are held in a library, archive, museum, or on the internet.\n\nNotably, it does not attempt to reproduce the formalisms of [FRBR](https://www.ifla.org/node/2016) and similar abstract models, as manifested by [FRBRoo](https://www.ifla.org/publications/node/11240), [BibFrame](http://www.loc.gov/bibframe/docs/index.html), or other complex conceptual hierarchies, but instead provide as simple as possible a model to accomplish core bibliographic reference tasks. \n\n## Physical Objects, Conceptual Texts\n\nThe first distinction that is needed is between the physical or digital carrier of the text, and the text itself.  Like the `VisualItem` pattern for the [artwork's visual content shown by objects](/model/object/aboutness/#depiction), the `LinguisticObject` that represents the text of a work can be `carried` by more than one `HumanMadeObject` and `digitally_carried_by` `DigitalObject` instances.  In this way, all of the copies of a particular book carry the same information content, that only needs to be described once and can act as a single connection point.\n\nLike other `LinguisticObject`s, it can have a `content` property for the actual text of the work, classifications, languages and so forth.\n\n!!! note \"Oral Histories\"\n    The linguistic content does not need to be ever written down with symbols for it to be considered a `LinguisticObject`, it could be transmitted entirely through oral traditions. Equally, an interview could be recorded without ever being transcribed and the information transmitted would still be a `LinguisticObject` as it is transmitted through the use of human language, rather than visual depictions. \n\n\n__Example:__\n\nYale University Library holds a copy of Koot's book about The Night Watch.\n\n",

As there might be many physical copies with the same structure, it is common to describe the pagination of the content as it applies to the content in general, rather than the many physical objects that carry that content. This is justifiable, mostly for convenience, but also because the text is divided up into sections which happen to correspond to the physical carrier's structure. Pagination (_aat:300200294_) or Foliation (_aat:300200662_) statements are the most common way to represent this, as simple descriptive fields following the core statement pattern. \n\nThe structured way is to have a Dimension associated with the object or work that gives the count of pages. This follows the regular pattern for counting parts. The easiest way to describe the page range of a particular section of a larger collection is with a pagination statement.  The disadvantage of the approach is that it is not computationally available for processing.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe introduction chapter to Koot's book is 10 pages long.\n\n",

Some general examples would include The Lord of the Rings, as conceptualized and originally written by Tolkien in English, but subsequently turned into a films, such as by Peter Jackson, and other interpretations of the same abstract work. While not a strict LRM or FRBR model, this does allow the mapping of the \"Work\" level into an appropriately abstract class in Linked Art.\n\nThe abstract work has all of the same features as the Linguistic Object with the exception of `language`. Linguistic, Visual and other Abstract works can be `conceptually_part_of` Abstract works to connect them together in a hierarchy. \n\n__Example:__\n\nThe text of Koot's book is conceptually part of a larger more abstract work of his conceptualization of the research and discussion, which might have multiple editions, translations or instantiations.\n\n",
