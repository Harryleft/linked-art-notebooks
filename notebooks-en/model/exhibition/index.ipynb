The exhibition is often presented at different venues over time, and might be part of a series such as the World Fairs or annual exhibitions.\n\nThe model divides exhibitions across two separate entities: the activity of exhibiting the objects that occured at a place and point in time, and the conceptual notion of the exhibition. This separation is important as activities are not `about` anything, and for exhibitions that were planned but cancelled (perhaps due to a war, a pandemic, or just loss of financing) the conceptual exhibition allows the description of the idea without asserting that it actually occured.\n\n\n## Exhibition Activity\n\nThere is an activity which is the exhibiting of the objects.  In particular, the exhibition occurs at a certain time given in `timespan`, at a certain place or places given in `took_place_at`, and was organized by some actor or actors, likely organizations, given in `carried_out_by`. It can be recognized as an exhibition using the classification of _aat:300054766_, \"exhibitions\". Exhibitions link to the set of objects exhibited with the `used_specific_object` property to a [Set](/model/collection/)\n\nNote that exhibitions as activities do not have a theme or subject, instead the activity is `influenced_by` an abstract work -- the idea of the Exhibition, described in the next section.\n\n__Example:__\n\nManet and Modern Beauty at the Getty, October 2019 to January 2020, was carried out by the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, and influenced by the idea behind the exhibition.\n\n",

The concept is created by the people who originally think up the exhibition, long before any of the pieces are collected together.  The exhibition concept likely has some theme that results in a coherent set of objects being presented, which could be as complex as post-industrial life or as simple as the life's work of a particular artist.\n\nThe concept is modeled as a `PropositionalObject`, and `classified_as` _aat:300417531_ to ensure that it's clearly tagged as an exhibition and separate from the activity. It can have all of basic patterns, such as names, identifiers, references, as well as rights and subjects.\n\nNote that this \"abstract work\" pattern can be used for other modeling scenarios as well, including performance art, theatre or other performing arts, the \"work\" notion from bibliographic modeling as described in the [document model](/model/document/). If the entity can be \"about\" something but is not directly a Linguistic or Visual work, then `PropositionalObject` is the most likely class.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe idea (or abstract work) for the Manet and Modern Beauty exhibition is about Manet and Beauty.\n\n",

   "source": "\n\n### Known Artist without Known Objects\n\nA frequently encountered situation is that we know about a historical exhibition and which artist or artists had works that were exhibited, but do not know any of the individual works. As the artist was likely not present at the exhibition, nor was involved in planning or otherwise executing it, they cannot be a participant in the activity, nor in the conceptualization of the activity. Equally, we might know of an exhibition that was planned around an artist, but it may never have actually occured.  Finally, we may wish to link an artist to the exhibition regardless of whether we know the objects or not.\n\nThe link to the artist is thus on the Exhibition Concept, rather than related to the activity. If the exhibition is about the artist specifically, then the concept can be `about` the artist. If the artist is just known to have had works used in the exhibition, then its `Creation` should be `influenced_by` the artist. It can also, of course, be both.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe conceptualization of the \"Manet and Modern Beauty\" exhibition was influenced by the Manet and his work.\n\n",

In this case, each of the different locations is treated as an exhibition activity in its own right, and then a broader \"travelling exhibition\" _(aat:300054773)_ is created that these are part of.  Note that the travelling exhibition can have separate properties from its parts, such as a `label` to distinguish the joint nature and a broader `timespan` that covers all of the venues. There is no need to duplicate the organizations and locations in the travelling exhibition, these can be determined more easily by looking at the exhibitions that it consists of.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe Art Institute of Chicago exhibited Manet and Modern Beauty in Chicago with a specific set of objects, and is part of the larger multi-venue exhibition.\n\n",

This event is modeled in the same way as other [Custody](/model/provenance/custody/) changes.  \n\nFor each exhibition, the custody of the object is transferred from the previous custodian to the next. In the simple case of a single venue for the exhibition, the first transfer is likely to be from the owner to the organization responsible for the exhibition, and then at the end of the exhibition, the custody is transferred back again.  In a more complex scenario with multiple venues, each organization hosting the exhibition will likely transfer custody to the next in the sequence.  \n\nHowever, when the object being exhibited at the location is owned by the same organization, there is no transfer of custody. The equivalent activity is likely to be simply moving the object from its regular location to the exhibition space. This is described in the same way as other [Movement](/model/provenance/movement/) events.\n\nThe provenance activities can be linked to the Exhibition by asserting that they are `part_of` the Exhibition activity.\n\n\n### Exhibition Specific Titles\n\nThe curators for exhibitions sometimes assign new titles or names for objects. This is an instance of the [Context Specific Assertions](/model/assertion/#context-specific-assertions) pattern.\n\n\n",
