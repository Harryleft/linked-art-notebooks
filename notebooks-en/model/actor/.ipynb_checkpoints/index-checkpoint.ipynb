    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "All activities are carried out by some actor, either a person (`Person`) or a group of people (`Group`) such as an organization or company.  The identity and description of these actors are very important to record in order to provide the human context for the activities, and their related places and objects. The creators, finders, owners, sellers and curators of objects are all relevant to understanding our cultural heritage.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as scope goes, the model currently does not consider that non-humans (such as software or animals) can perform activities, as activities require some notion of intent. Thus the productions of the [infamous monkey selfies from 2011](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/24/us/monkey-selfie-peta-appeal/index.html) are not carried out by anyone, as the monkey cannot do it and the photographer did not intend for the photographs to be taken. A workaround for this is simply to create a `Person` record for the non-human, until the model can catch up.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model does not aim to capture all of the possible information about a Person or Group, or all their relationships to other people, objects, places or activities. Instead it attempts to capture sufficient information for a human or machine to distinguish the actor from others and to understand their role in history. Future versions or independent extensions might add additional features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary classes of acting agent, `Person` and `Group`. `Person` is used for humans, and `Group` is used for any collective set of humans.  Groups typically are able to take action as a coherent whole, but in some cases this is overlooked for simplicity's sake.  For example, it is reasonable to have a Group that represents 18th Century French Impressionist artists, however such a group is an artifical construct and thus could not have acted as a single entity. It is also useful to be able to say that \"The Museum\" acquired a painting or \"The Workshop\" produced a sculpture, when in fact it was some very small subset of the members of the group that actually performed the activity and we do not know exactly who. Also, it is not necessary that the Group be aware of the other members, nor take any intentional act to join the Group, members can be added after their deaths. \n",
    "\n",
    "If it is not known whether an actor is a Person or a Group, then the safer default is Group. For example, if a sale of an object is listed as being from an art dealer called \"Smith\", it is unclear whether it refers to a person via their family name, or to an organization named after its owner. The rationale for using `Group` is that it could be a group consisting of a single person, or a group that is otherwise arbitrarily defined. \n",

    "## Life Events\n",
    "\n",
    "There are key events in a person or organization's existence that are often recorded as they contribute core information for determining the identity of the actor.  These include the birth or formation, death or dissolution, and the period in which they carried out the work they are known for.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Birth and Death / Formation and Dissolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the production of objects or the creation of texts, people and organizations also come into and out of existence through events.  These events can take place at certain Places, happen at certain times, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "People are born in `Birth` events and die in `Death` events, related to the person by the `born` and `died` properties respectively. Groups are formed in `Formation` activities, and dissolved in `Dissolution` activities, referenced via the `formed_by` and `dissolved_by` properties. `Birth` and `Death` are modeled not as Activities, but as Events that are not carried out by anyone. They are the coming into existence instant of the person, not the conception, the labor, or potentially the killing by a murderer. These activities can be modeled as causes, as described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Birth and Death do not have any properties of their own that are used in the model, only those inherited from event, such as `timespan` and `took_place_at`.\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! \"note\" \"Inanimate Thing or Dead Person?\"\n",
    "    After death, people are still instances of `Person` which is a subclass of `Actor`, even though they can no longer carry out activities.  People in comas or otherwise completely incapacitated also cannot carry out activities, but are not temporarily non-Actors. The modeling that death is a transformation from an instance of Person to an instance of Thing adds complexity for the sake of purity, but does not add any actual value. Thus a burial activity (_aat:300263485_) buries a Person, not a Thing-that-used-to-be-a-Person. However if the skeleton is later dug up, it is likely documented as a Physical Thing. There is, therefore, a transition at some undetermined point.\n",

As Group is a sub-class of Actor, it is not thought to be an appropriate class for this use.
