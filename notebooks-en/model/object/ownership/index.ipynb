This level of detail is often not available for all objects, and it is beneficial to have the current ownership, custody and location of objects available in the object record directly. \n\nEven if there are detailed records of the ownership history for an object, these are still likely limited to the basics of who owned it, when, and how they acquired it. The acquisition is also likely for the object by itself, and what was paid or exchanged for it is very infrequently able to be published. For this 99% case, the transfers of ownership can be listed in the object record instead of in separate provenance records, but can be linked to them if they do exist. This pattern does **not** extend to changes of custody or location.\n\n\n## Current and Normal Owners, Custodians and Locations\n\n### Ownership\n\nThe current owner of the object should be referenced with `transferred_title_to` in the most recent `Acquisition` that `transferred_title_of` the object. These transfers are described in detail in the [Acquistion](/model/provenance/acquisition) section of the provenance model, and in the reduced version described below within the object record.\n\nTo make the current owner easier to find in the data, the owner should also be referenced with `current_owner` from the object itself. There are further modeling details available about [People and Organizations](/model/actor) that might own objects.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe current owner of Spring is the Getty.\n\n",

The equivalent property to `current_owner` for custody is `current_custodian`.  Transfers of custody are described in more detail in the section on [custody](/model/provenance/custody).\n\nIf there is a department or person that is not the owner but is responsible for the object, then that actor is the `current_custodian`. Similarly, loans between organizations (either temporary or permanent) transfer custody rather than ownership.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe Night Watch is owned by the City of Amsterdam, and on permanent loan to the Rijksmuseum.\n\n",

It is useful in this circumstance to know who the usual or normal custodian of the object is when it's different from the current custodian. For example, if (and this is a very big \"if\" given the real world size of the painting) the Night Watch was ever loaned to another organization, then the owner would remain the city, the current custodian would be the exhibiting organization, and the Rijksmuseum would remain the normal custodian. This uses a property called `current_permanent_custodian`.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe Night Watch is also (entirely hypothetically) loaned to the Getty Museum.\n\n",
