For general, textual statements about rights information the model uses the LinguisticObject pattern that should now be familiar.  For more specific rights that can be identified individually, such as copyright, and optionally who holds those rights, there is the ability to assert them in a machine readable way.\n\n## Credit / Attribution Statement\n\nIt is important to be able to give a credit or attribution statement that should be displayed along with the object. For example, a painting that has been donated might have the requirement to state who the donor was. This is modeled using the statement pattern as a `LinguisticObject`, that is `classified_as` _aat:300026687_ - the term for \"acknowledgements\". The text is given in the `content` property.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe Night Watch is on loan to the Rijksmuseum from the City of Amsterdam.\n\n",

The difference is that it is `classified_as` _aat:300435434_ - the term for license or legal statements.\nSuch rights statements might be associated with the physical object or with the visual work, but likely should be associated with the work (the image that has or had copyright, rather than the bits of matter that carry it).\n\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe visual content of the Night Watch is in the Public Domain.\n\n",

These patterns associate a `Right` that the object is `subject_to`, and then give more detail about the nature of that right, such as what sort of right, and who holds it.\n\nEach Right is a tied specifically to the entity that is subject to the right, rather than being the broader class of such a right, and thus the Right is the status of the object, not the legal construct. We still need a way to have a reference to the type of right or license being asserted, and for this we use the `classified_as` property. The URI for the classification can be anything, but is most commonly a rightsstatements.org URI or a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) URI.\n\nThere is a recent effort to standardize rights statements, described at [rightsstatements.org](http://rightsstatements.org/).  Twelve basic rights statements were identified and given URIs to identify them.  If any of these statements apply, it is useful to use these URIs to ensure that client systems can process them the in the same way. \n\nThese rights must be associated with the Work, rather than the Object, if they are about the copyright or other use of the image rather than the physical object. Asserting that you can reuse \"The Night Watch\" does not give you any physical rights over the object in the Rijksmuseum, it gives you usage rights over the visual content.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe visual content of the Night Watch is in the Public Domain.\n\n",
