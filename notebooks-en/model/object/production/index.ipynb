Each of these components captures the details of one particular artist's role in the production of the object. This allows us to assert different properties for each artist's contribution, including different times, techniques, roles, locations or influences.\n\nFor consistency, it is RECOMMENDED that this pattern also be used for production activities when only one artist is known, such that it is easier to add further contributors to the work without restructuring the content. However this is not required, to ensure compatibility with existing systems.\n\nNote that these parts of productions can also have statements associated with them, describing the role in more detail beyond just the classification, technique or other structured data.\n\n__Example:__\n\nA [painted textile called \"RÜN\"](https://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/153900), where the linen was hand-woven by Sarah Parke and then painted by Mark Barrow.\n\n\n",

The \"master\" might not have participated in the group, or even been alive when it was formed, and hence does not necessarily form the group or was even a member of it. \n\nThis approach can be used for workshops, studios, the set of pupils, followers, and so forth.

The actor that is referenced in `carried_out_by` is the current opinion, but previous attributions can still be recorded. The pattern used for this is described in more detail in the [assertions](/model/assertion/) section of the documentation.\n\n\n## Production by Removal\n\nIt is possible for an object to come into documentary existence when it is removed from a larger object.  The production of the part is simply part of the production of the whole, but until it is removed, it does not need a separate identity or existence.\n\nThis occurs reasonably frequently, for both valid and unscrupulous motivations.  In the work of conservation, it is often necessary to remove a tiny flake of an object to experiment with, before applying the method to the whole.  If there are unexpected side effects of the experiment, then the whole object is saved at the expense of an unnoticeable change. It is important to know that the sample was produced in the past and removed in the present, rather than it was created in the present.\n\nA second scenario when this occurs is unfortunately common.  If an object, such as a medieval manuscript, can be sold for a higher profit by splitting it up into parts and selling each part individually, then unscrupulous sellers will do just that. Rather than sell an innocuous book of hours to a single buyer, instead each illumination can be sold individually and then the remaining text-bearing pages either dumped or sold over time at a greatly reduced price.  This dispersal of manuscripts still occurs today.\n\nIn order to model this, instead of a `Production`, the object is `removed_by` a `PartRemoval` activity.  That activity is just like all other activities, however it also has a `diminished` property that refers to the whole object from which the part was removed.  It is not normally useful to have a separate `Production` for the part, if the information about the source object it was removed from is known.\n\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe collection item is a page from a gradual (manuscript) by the Master of the Libro dei Notai.

This would be appropriate for fossils, gemstones, or other natural history items, along with objects that were created but no information is available about that production or the \"discovery\" of the object is the first significant entry in the item's provenance. This pattern may only be used for the discovery of the object, rather than other sorts of encounters.\n\nEncounters may also be recorded as separate events, as described in the [provenance section](../../provenance/encounters/). The separate event must be used for any encounter that is not a discovery.\n\nInstead of `produced_by`, the property used is `encountered_by`, and the class of the activity is `Encounter`. All of the other patterns are the same, including where the encounter took place, who encountered it, when it occurred and so forth.

Loss of the object leaves the chain open ended as it might be recovered in the future, however if the object is destroyed then there is no coming back. Objects should, thus, only be recorded as destroyed if they are known to be so.\n\nThe model uses a `Destruction` class that represents the going out of existence of the object. A destruction only applies to a single object, and thus every object has their own destruction, even if that destruction was caused by the same wider event or activity.
