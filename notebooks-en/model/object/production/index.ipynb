The relationship from the object to the activity is `produced_by`, and the `Production` activity itself follows the general [base activity model](/model/base/#events-and-activities) with the description of time, location and agents.\n\n__Example:__\n\nSimilar to the Production example in the basic patterns, \"The Night Watch\" was created by Rembrandt in Amsterdam in 1642.\n\n",

Techniques have their own property (`technique` rather than `classified_as`) and can thus easily be distinguished from other classifications.\n\n### Techniques\n\nIf there is a particular technique known to have been used in the creation of the object, this can be expressed using the `technique` property, referring to a controlled vocabulary term for the technique. This should be used to capture specific techniques or methods, and the base `classified_as` property used for more general classifications of the activity.  More general classifications are more common on individual roles, discussed below.\n \n__Example:__\n\nThe [sculpture \"Bust of a Man\"](https://collections.britishart.yale.edu/catalog/tms:54430) was created by Francis Hardwood using the sculpting technique.\n\n",

Each of these components captures the details of one particular artist's role in the production of the object. This allows us to assert different properties for each artist's contribution, including different times, techniques, roles, locations or influences.\n\nFor consistency, it is RECOMMENDED that this pattern also be used for production activities when only one artist is known, such that it is easier to add further contributors to the work without restructuring the content. However this is not required, to ensure compatibility with existing systems.\n\nNote that these parts of productions can also have statements associated with them, describing the role in more detail beyond just the classification, technique or other structured data.\n\n__Example:__\n\nA [painted textile called \"RÜN\"](https://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/153900), where the linen was hand-woven by Sarah Parke and then painted by Mark Barrow.\n\n\n",

The use of the particular source object can be captured as part of the description of the `Production` of the object using the `used_specific_object` property.\n\nNote that all of the art objects created from the same source will show the same image, be it flat or three dimensional.

The \"master\" might not have participated in the group, or even been alive when it was formed, and hence does not necessarily form the group or was even a member of it. \n\nThis approach can be used for workshops, studios, the set of pupils, followers, and so forth.

The actor that is referenced in `carried_out_by` is the current opinion, but previous attributions can still be recorded. The pattern used for this is described in more detail in the [assertions](/model/assertion/) section of the documentation.\n\n\n## Production by Removal\n\nIt is possible for an object to come into documentary existence when it is removed from a larger object.  The production of the part is simply part of the production of the whole, but until it is removed, it does not need a separate identity or existence.\n\nThis occurs reasonably frequently, for both valid and unscrupulous motivations.  In the work of conservation, it is often necessary to remove a tiny flake of an object to experiment with, before applying the method to the whole.  If there are unexpected side effects of the experiment, then the whole object is saved at the expense of an unnoticeable change. It is important to know that the sample was produced in the past and removed in the present, rather than it was created in the present.\n\nA second scenario when this occurs is unfortunately common.  If an object, such as a medieval manuscript, can be sold for a higher profit by splitting it up into parts and selling each part individually, then unscrupulous sellers will do just that. Rather than sell an innocuous book of hours to a single buyer, instead each illumination can be sold individually and then the remaining text-bearing pages either dumped or sold over time at a greatly reduced price.  This dispersal of manuscripts still occurs today.\n\nIn order to model this, instead of a `Production`, the object is `removed_by` a `PartRemoval` activity.  That activity is just like all other activities, however it also has a `diminished` property that refers to the whole object from which the part was removed.  It is not normally useful to have a separate `Production` for the part, if the information about the source object it was removed from is known.\n\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe collection item is a page from a gradual (manuscript) by the Master of the Libro dei Notai.

This would be appropriate for fossils, gemstones, or other natural history items, along with objects that were created but no information is available about that production or the \"discovery\" of the object is the first significant entry in the item's provenance. This pattern may only be used for the discovery of the object, rather than other sorts of encounters.\n\nEncounters may also be recorded as separate events, as described in the [provenance section](../../provenance/encounters/). The separate event must be used for any encounter that is not a discovery.\n\nInstead of `produced_by`, the property used is `encountered_by`, and the class of the activity is `Encounter`. All of the other patterns are the same, including where the encounter took place, who encountered it, when it occurred and so forth. The role pattern also applies, with the `part`s of the encounter also being `Encounter`s.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe fossil Torosaurus (VP.04072) was encountered in 1891 by John Bell Hatcher.\n\n",

Loss of the object leaves the chain open ended as it might be recovered in the future, however if the object is destroyed then there is no coming back. Objects should, thus, only be recorded as destroyed if they are known to be so.\n\nThe model uses a `Destruction` class that represents the going out of existence of the object. A destruction only applies to a single object, and thus every object has their own destruction, even if that destruction was caused by the same wider event or activity.  This means that the Destruction is not `carried_out_by` an actor, but instead (as in the following section) another activity causes the destruction.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe painting \"Le Peintre\" by Picasso was destroyed (in a plane crash) on September 2nd, 1998 at about 10:30pm.

A museum burning down or otherwise being destroyed would destroy many objects, including the building itself. On a smaller scale, an individual destruction could be caused by a particular activity of an individual. \n\nIn order to distinguish between the destruction itself and its cause, we use the `caused_by` relationship between the Destruction and the Activity or Event that caused it. The event should be described and classified as any other event in the model.\n\n__Example:__\n\nLe Peintre was destroyed because of the plane crashing. (Which also would have caused the destruction of the plane, the death of the crew, passengers and many other consequences)\n\n",
