The model allows for both being explicit in the data for these, as well as simply including a textual description.  The explicit form is preferred, however it is recognized that not all systems will be able to provide it. \n\nBeyond dimensions and materials, the model allows for the description of parts of objects, and parts of parts, using the base pattern.  These parts can be thought of as objects in their own right, and thus have titles (\"Left Panel\" of a triptych), descriptions, rights, images, dimensions, materials, and so forth.   \n\n## Dimensions\n\nThe physical dimensions of an object, such as height, width, diameter or weight, are included in the `dimension` property, and consist of three primary pieces of information:  \n\n* The numeric value in `value`.\n* The type of dimension (e.g. height vs width) in `classified_as`, referencing an external vocabulary of dimension types.\n* The `unit` used to align the value with the real world such as inches, pounds or seconds. The unit should also be given from a controlled vocabulary.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe Night Watch is 379.5 cm high, by 453.5 cm wide.\n\n",

This could be useful, for example, to distinguish the time and method by which the measurement was taken, or to know who used which instrument in a conservation research setting to promote accuracy and reusability of results. \n\nIn order to build upon the dimension model described above, the model adds an `AttributeAssignment` activity to the `Dimension` which is the measuring activity, following the [Assertion](/model/assertion/) pattern. The `Dimension` is `assigned_by` the `AttributeAssignment`, to the object which has the dimension.  In this particular case, as dimensions are specific to the object, and the `dimension` property is explicit in the model already, there is no need to link from the `AttributeAssignment` back to the object, or to give the property that is being assigned. It is permitted, but no new information is being added and hence it is not recommended.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe measurement of the Night Watch was carried out by the \"Operation Night Watch\" team, during \"[Operation Night Watch](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/operation-night-watch)\" \n\n",

If there is a record for the part, separate from the full object, then the dimension can be associated with that part of the object directly, but it is inconvenient to make separate records for all of the possible aspects that could be measured, and impossible to manage object state in this way.\n\nIf there isn't a requirement to have multiple dimensions connected, and there isn't an interoperability or searchability requirement to be able to distinguish them computationally, then a display Name or a Statement is likely sufficient to explain to a human reader what was being measured.\n\nIf this is a requirement, then instead we add the `technique` property on the `AttributeAssignment` discussed in the previous section as a way to reference the method in which the measurement was taken. The technique would represent, for example, \"measuring the base\" or \"measuring while open\". The same technique would be added to each of the measurements for the particular feature -- the height, width, and depth of the statue's base would all have the \"measuring the base\" technique as a way to connect them together.\n\n/// note | Note: Missing Vocabulary\nThese techniques are unlikely to exist in shared vocabularies, and implementers are thus very likely to have to create their own based on local practice.\n///\n\n__Example:__\n\nSpring has \"Framed [Outer Dim]\" and \"Unframed\" dimensions.

The first approach might be done with instruments measuring the reflected light off the original, or via digital photography and computing the color from the resulting digital image.  The second approach is likely carried out by a curator in describing the object in a collection management system, hopefully using a controlled set of terms. As it is desirable to have only a single place to look for information, the model for color tries to capture both of these possibilities at once in as simple a way as possible, allowing either or both to happen for any given color.\n\nMeasurements record a `Dimension`, and thus we create an instance of the class to record the color, even if the measurement is a categorization. The dimension has a `value` and `unit`, just like the more obvious physical dimensions described above. For an RGB colorspace, the value must be converted into an integer from the more traditional three-part hexadecimal value, as values are always decimalized. This allows the true value to be recorded.  The dimension can also be `classified_as` a particular color family -- the object has a color which is a green color, for example. Either or both of these patterns can be used, and multiple dimensions using this pattern can be recorded without having to match up which categories map to which values. The traditional hex string for the color can be given as the `content` of an Identifier for the dimension. \n\n__Example:__\n\nThe Night Watch is primarily a brown color (`B35A1F`), which is categorized as being brown (_aat:300127490_)\n\n",

   "source": "\n\n!!! note \"Implementation Note\"\n\n\tIn order to generate an integer value from a hexadecimal value is typically very easy in most programming languages. In Python, for example, it is simply `int(\"B35A1F\", 16)`. The reverse is also true, with the equivalent being `hex(11754015)`. As such, the unobvious value of `11754015` is not wonderful from a data-readability perspective, but the implementation is very straightforward and thus the consistency with all other dimensions is deemed to provide more usability than having a special case of `value` that takes a string instead of an integer. The string containing the hex code can be carried as an Identifier on the Dimension instance.\n\n\n## Shapes\n\nWhile some combinations of dimensions can give a sense of the shape of the object, it is also often useful to be more explicit.  For example, a shield-shaped painting (perhaps due to being painted on an actual shield) would likely still only have height and width given. Without the additional information of the shape, it might be concluded that the painting is rectangular. Similarly, a circular object could be mistaken as a square, as the height and width would be the same in either case.\n\nShapes are given as classifications on the object via the `classified_as` property.  The classification is then further classified as being a shape, with the term _aat:300056273_, in the same way that being a painting is further classified as being the type of work.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe Night Watch is a landscape format painting, as it is wider than it is high.\n\n",

Physical objects are particularly amenable to this, and allows reuse of the rest of the model as needed.  The parts do not need to be physically separable without destroying the object, but do need to be objectively definable in terms of the matter that makes it up.  For example, the arm of a sculpture could have dimensions and materials, but while an arch-shaped space in a rock formation might have dimensions, it could not be removed, nor is it made of anything, and thus it is not a part.\n\nPhysical parts are linked to the whole using the `part_of` property, and use the same `HumanMadeObject` class. The `classified_as` property can be used to be more specific as to the sort of part, in this case the support for the painting, which is in turn made of canvas. The type of part is then further classified as _aat:300241583_ to ensure that it can be distinguished as a part-type, rather than an object-type.\n\nThe model does not have a separate parts statement to describe this in a human-readable way, as this is traditionally done using the materials statement as demonstrated above.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe support part of the Night Watch is made of canvas, and part of the Night Watch.\n\n",
