The majority of use cases, however, are to get the current information.  The assignment of attributes model allows for this additional information to be associated, without making every property a list of historical values.\n\nThis pattern is also used for context-specific assertions, such as when an object is given a label or description for the purposes of an exhibition or other event.  This exhibition label does not replace the owning museum's title, but is useful for historical comparison and research purposes.\n\nThe use of context specific assertions or other attribute assignments should be kept to a minimum if possible. The data structure is significantly more complex than other patterns, which reduces the likelihood of implementation and increases the difficult of search queries. This pattern should only be used if there is no other way to express the knowledge, and it is important to capture with all of the details.\n\n## Assigning Attributes\n\nThe `AttributeAssignment` class is an `Activity`, typically carried out by curators or researchers rather than by artists or collectors, that assigns information to entities in the model. This can be used to assign any property or relationship on any entity that can be the _subject_ of such a property.  The general Activity properties of `carried_out_by`, `timespan` and `took_place_at` are available for when and where the assignment happened, and who made it.  The `timespan` is the moment when the assignment took place, rather than the length of time that the assignment was held to be true by some audience.\n\nThis pattern is useful when you do not want to assert the relationship directly, such as for a name that was previously given to the object but is no longer actively used. Or an attribution of an artist that is possibly true, but might only be an informed guess.\n\nThe value of the assignment is given using `assigned`, and it can be a reference to any entity. The entity that the value is assigned to is given using the `attributed_by` property on that entity, and the relationship between them is given using `assigned_property`. Thus an `AttributeAssignment` can assign an `Actor` to a `Production` with the `carried_out_by` relationship or a `Material` to an object with the `made_of` property.  In terms of the relationship that the `AttributeAssignment` expresses, the entity with the `attributed_by` property is the subject of the relationship, the relationship itself is given in `assigned_property`, and the object of the relationship is given in `assigned`, thereby making up a regular 'triple' of subject, predicate, object.\n\n__Example:__\n\nIt is asserted in 2015 that \"Spring\" has a material of canvas.\n\n**NOTE WELL** This is an illustrative example only, and without further reason, the simple `made_of` property should instead be used.\n\n",

   "source": "\n\n### Assigned Value as Subject Entity\n\nIn other situations the appropriate entity with which to associate the `AttributeAssignment` is the one being assigned. In this case we flip the `AttributeAssignment` around and use `assigned_by` on the value of the assignment (the object of the relationship), and do not specify the subject of the relationship as it's the entity which refers to it. For example, it is very useful to be able to assert which organization created and assigned an `Identifier` to an object in order to disambiguate that organization's identifier from another organization's identifier of the same type, such as accession numbers.  Another use case is giving further information about a particular `Dimension` associated with the object, such as who measured it, when, with which instrument, and so on.\n\nIn this case, the subject of the relationship is the entity which refers to the value, the predicate is that relationship, and the object is the entity with the `assigned_by` property which refers to the AttributeAssignment.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe Kehinde Wiley painting \"Portrait of Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, Jacob Morland of Capplethwaite\" is jointly owned by the Yale University Art Gallery and the Yale Center for British Art. Both organizations have assigned their own accession numbers to the painting, and both are correct simultaneously.\n\n",

This is modeled using the attribute assignment pattern, with a reference to the entity that provided the information in the `used_specific_object` field. This could be a database, or the text of a book, a physical object or other entity types.

   "source": "\n\n### Creation Details of Embedded Statements\n\nIn order to give credit for the creation of [statements](/model/base/) embedded within other records, it is possible to add a `created_by` property on to the statement as if it were a full textual work record. This allows the creator and other creation information to be recorded in the regular way using `carried_out_by`. This is especially useful for noting contributions from external or more junior participants who might not otherwise receive any acknowledgement for their participation in the knowledge creation.\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence can be recorded as the `technique` of the creation, with a recommended [vocabulary term](/model/vocab/) of \"aat:300456842\", or if a particular AI tool is used, it can be listed with `used_specific_object` on the `Creation`. The URIs to use for specific AI tools are not recommended at the moment, however if certain tools become popular they will be added to the vocabulary section. Note that if AI is used but there is no other information about the creation of the statement, then an easier option is to use `classified_as` on the Statement directly, with a vocabulary term of \"aat:300456841\" for \"AI Generated Content\".  The technique or the classification can also be used with `AttributeAssignment` when the assignment is being made by an AI. Consumers of content that is marked in these ways as being generated using an AI system might wish to tag the content as such in a user interface, or otherwise allow filtering or sorting of such artificial content.\n\n!!! note \"Scope of Description\"\n    Please note that this pattern does not allow for individual relationships to be flagged as being generated by an\n    AI. For example, if software extracted the list of materials from a statement and created a series of `made_of`\n    references to actual `Material` instances, these links cannot be reified to add the creation information, just\n    as they cannot be reified to add a human who asserted the relationship. The use of `AttributeAssignment`, as above,\n    is possible but not encouraged.\n\nAnother use case is to associate rights information with the statement, separate from any asserted license on the overall dataset. This follows the regular `subject_to` pattern, as described in the [rights section](/model/object/rights/). In this way the overall factual information about an object or person can have a more permissive license than text or other more custom or potentially valuable content.\n\nIt must be noted that all of this functionality is available for any `LinguisticObject` record as well.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe description of The Night Watch was generated by an AI at a particular point in time, and is licensed as CC-BY.\n\n",

This will often appear in human-oriented user interfaces with a label like \"Related Place\" or \"Related Person\". The use of AttributeAssignment in this way should be as a last resort for when there isn't any way to be more specific that just \"there is a relationship\". A scenario in which this might be useful and justified is to explicitly connect \"related\" objects in a collection, where the related-ness is via some computed similarity measure. Equally, the underlying data format might not be explicit as to the relationship between the entities, and the attribute assignment pattern is as close as can be expressed.\n\nThis would also cover the use case of \"representative objects\" for an artist, or other similar \"highlight\" reels. There isn't a particular relationship between the artist and the object that isn't already covered by the model, but it's desirable to have some predetermined choices made rather than allowing a system to randomly pick which objects to use. These could have a reference to http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300028875 in `classified_as` on the `AttributeAssignment` to distinguish them.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe Night Watch is related to another object in the Rijksmuseum collection \"Nachtwacht\", but the relationship is not captured specifically.\n\n",

For example the student/teacher relationship between people is a social construct that can't be captured easily, but is still of importance for art history. There are far too many such relationships, especially in the social arena, to model them all separately or create extension properties for each, and thus an `AttributeAssignment` for the relationship is the approach taken. Finding appropriate properties to use to describe the relationship, either as `classified_as` or `assigned_property` is up to the implementer. Giving a display name with `identified_by` on the `AttributeAssignment` is recommended.\n\n/// note | Social Constructs as Groups\nNote that many social relationships could be modeled as `Joining` and `Leaving` a `Group` with a particular role, via `classified_as` on the `Joining` activity. For example, the Group represents the social bond between the teacher and the student, the teacher joins the group as the teacher, the student as the student. This is possible, but introduces a lot of additional overhead with identity for the \"Group\" of the relationship.\n///\n\n\n__Example:__\n\nFerdinand Bol was a student of Rembrandt.\n\n",
