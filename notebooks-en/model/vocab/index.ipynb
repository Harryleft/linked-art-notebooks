There isn't a difference at the ontology level between a book or a painting or a bridge, they're all instances of the class `HumanMadeObject`. This makes it easy to be interoperable at the ontological level, however in order to compare data across institutions or datasets, there must also be interoperability at the vocabulary level to avoid thinking that the bridge should be counted in the same way as the painting.\n\nAny entity in the model can have one or more classifications associated with it using the `classified_as` property, as discussed in the [Types and Classifications](/model/base/#types-and-classifications) section. Consistency in the use of URIs for those classifications will make the data easier to use for everyone. The vocabulary has been divided into three different sets, based on how important it is to reuse the terms.\n\n\n## Terms by Requirement Class\n\n* [Required Terms](required/) -- you **must** use these terms to be considered to have implemented Linked Art\n* [Recommended Terms](recommended/) -- you **should** use these terms unless you have a specific reason not to\n* [Optional Terms](optional/) -- you **may** use these terms, but should feel no compulsion to if there's a reason not to\n\n## Usage\n\nThe reference to the vocabulary entry can be either directly in the `id` of the reference, or as an embedded `equivalent` to an intermediary. For the purposes of conformance and utility, the following are both equally acceptable.\n\nVocabulary in `id`:\n\n",

While this is a weak interpretation of the semantic versioning requirements, it is intended to facilitate interoperability at the semantic layer as best practices and consistency emerge within the community without waiting for a major version.\n\nThe recommended list can also be updated with a new minor version, as not following the list does not break compatability with previous minor versions. This includes adding, removing and changing the URIs for entries in the list.\n\nThe optional list, as merely informational, is not semantically versioned and thus can be updated at any time.\n\nThe community should propose additions to the lists via [github](https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues) issues.\n\n",
