They are in the list because someone has found them to be useful, rather than that they are recommended for general use. If you don't have a reason to use a different term, then please use these. If you do have a reason to use a different term, that's totally okay. \n\nAlso, if you would like to suggest additions that you think would be interesting, for example new terms that mitigate a bias resulting from the somewhat ad hoc process of compiling the lists here, please [reach out](https://linked.art/community/)!\n\n\n## Types\n\n### Name Types\n\nSee the [name documentation](/model/base/#names).\n\n| Name                | URI           | Description |\n|---------------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Translated Title    | aat:300417194 | The Name is a translation of another name |\n| Sub-title           | aat:300312006 | The Name is part of a larger title, and is the sub-title |\n| Alias               | aat:300404664 | The Name is an alias or nickname, likely for a person |\n| Pseudonym           | aat:300404657 | The Name is a pseudonym, pen-name or other adopted name |\n\n\n\n### Identifier Types\n\nSee the [identifier documentation](/model/base/#identifiers).\n\n| Name                | URI           | Description |\n|---------------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Auction Lot Number  | aat:300404628 | The identifier, typically a number, for an auction lot.
