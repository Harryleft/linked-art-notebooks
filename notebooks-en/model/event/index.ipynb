These would include the activity that brings the entity into existence (productions, creations, births and formations), takes them out of existence (destructions, erasures, dissolutions) or otherwise significantly affects their appearance in the cultural record (when there were encountered, their publication, a person's professional activities). There are two broad classes of activity which have their own specific models -- the [provenance](../provenance/) or ownership history of the object, and [exhibitions](../exhibition/).\n\nThere are also periods of time, events and activities carried out by people which provide additional context to the objects, but are not directly tied to them. These sorts of temporal entity would include periods of time (the cretaceous period, the bronze age, the 17th century), events that occur but are not intentionally carried out by people (the eruption of Vesuvius, the fire of London, the COVID 19 pandemic), and activities carried out by people (the first Linked Art face to face meeting, the landing on the moon, Scott's journey to Antarctica). This part of the model concerns these latter types, as they are separate from the objects and works in the same way that people, places and concepts are.\n\n## Types\n\nThere are three types of temporal entity, as described above:\n\n* **Period**: A period of time, likely somewhat arbitrarily defined, such as an \"age\" or century.\n* **Event**: An event which occurs and then is finished, and typically changes the state of the world in some way.\n* **Activity**: An event that was intentionally or willfully carried out by humans, singularly or in a group.\n\nThese types or classes are recorded in `type` in the model.\n\n__Example:__ \n\nThe 19th Century is a period that spans from 1800 through the end of 1899.\n\n",

The eruption of Vesuvius would then be an Event, referenced from the Destruction event for the (physical) city of Pompeii using the `caused_by` property. The eruption is also depicted in many paintings, and is the subject of many books. As such, it must have its own record, so that the objects, works and events can refer to the same entity.\n\n__Example:__\n\nVesuvius erupts on August 24th, 79 CE.\n\n",

   "source": "\n\n## During vs Part Of\n\nThere are two relationships that describe how events are related to each other in terms of partitioning or inclusion, `part_of` and `during`. Each has a particular usage that should be adhered to carefully, otherwise searches and user interfaces will become very confusing and convoluted. \n\nFirstly, if one event is a strict part of another, and if you listed all of the parts, then the entire whole would be completed described, then the correct property to use is `part_of`.  For example, the Bronze Age consists of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Bronze Age and the Late Bronze Age. Each of those might be further subdivided into a hierarchy of periods.\n\nConversely, if we know that an artifact was created during the bronze age, we would not list that along side its parts. The relationship is one of inclusion, rather than strict partitioning, and often either a stand-in for an unknown and more explicit timespan, or a method to categorize or group the activities or events that occur during the broader context.  For example the Production activity for the artifact occured `during` the Bronze Age period, but is not one of the constituent parts like those listed above.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe Early Roman Empire period, from 31 BCE through 193 CE, is part of the Roman Empire period.\n\n",

For example, we might know from documentary evidence that an object was created before some event but have only the vaguest time period in which those two activities occured. We can describe the order between events using the properties `before` (the event with the property occured before the event in the value of the property) and `after` (the opposite). This is especially useful for provenance activities in order to form an ordered sequence of events, without knowing the dates of the sales.\n\n__Example:__\n\nA statue in Pompeii must have been created before the eruption of Vesuvius.\n\n",
