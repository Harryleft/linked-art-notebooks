In the descriptions below the terms 'seller' and 'buyer' are used to refer to the actor that is relinquishing ownership and the actor that is gaining ownership, even if there is no money or other goods or services changing hands. This is for clarity and conciseness of the descriptions, and not to imply that every transaction is a purchase.\n\n## Object Acquisition\n\nAcquisitions are used to describe the transfer of ownership of an object from one owner to the next. The first owner is typically the artist, who would then transfer it to the second owner, to the third owner and so on. The ownership chain can be expressed by repeating this same pattern with the buyer from one acquisition being the seller in the subsequent one.  If the previous owner (e.g. the seller) or the subsequent owner (e.g. the buyer) is not known for a particular acquisition, then the reference can be left out from the description.\n  \nThe acquistion is not necessarily a purchase, it could be a gift, an inheritance or any other method of gaining the right of ownership of an object.\n\nThe model encodes this information with an `Acquisition` part of the overall Provenance Event. The acquisition is the transfer of the right of ownership of an object (referenced in `transferred_title_of`) from the seller (in `transferred_title_from`) to the buyer (in `transferred_title_to`). \n\nEach object has its own Acquisition as part of the provenance event, so if a collector buys three paintings from a dealer, then there would be a single Provenance Event with three Acquisitions, all of which transfer the title of a single painting from the dealer to the collector.\n\n\n__Example:__\n\nOliver Payne acquired Spring from the Durand-Ruel Gallery in New York in 1909\n\n",

This can be modeled by associating a different person or group with the activity using `carried_out_by` as the relationship. Multiple agents can be listed in this way, but it is not possible to associate agents with the person or group they're working for -- the model does not have a notion of seller's agent as distinct from buyer's agent.\n\n__Example:__\n\nIn 2014, the family heirs of Oliver Payne sold Spring (by auction at Christie's) to Otto Naumann, acting for the J.

   "source": "\n\n\n## Payments\n\nA purchase is a common type of acquisition in which money is exchanged for the object.  The provenance event consists of the acquisition along with one or more related payments.  This typically involves a payment from the seller to the buyer for the agreed upon price, but might include further payments to or from others such as for shared ownership, payment of debts owed, or for services rendered as part of the overall activity.\n\nThe `Payment` activity has equivalent relationships for the actor that the money is transferred from (`paid_from`), the actor the money is transferred to (`paid_to`), and the amount of money paid (`paid_amount`).  The amount itself is a `MonetaryAmount` that has a value (`value`) and a currency (`currency`).  Each separable monetary amount is modeled as an individual instance of `Payment`, and thus if the buyer paid a commission to the agent who carried out the purchase, and paid for the object, then there would be two Payments, one from the buyer to the seller and one from the buyer to the agent. Commissions to auction houses or for consignments would use the same pattern.\n\n!!! note \"Diachronic Comparison of Monetary Amounts\"\n    The underlying ontology has specified that the `MonetaryAmount` refers to the face value of the combination of value and currency. This means that any comparison between `MonetaryAmount` instances should also take into account the datetimes of resources that reference it, rather than standing alone. It is unclear if the same `MonetaryAmount` can be used for all occurences of value and currency, or whether it is something more unique than that, and to be safe the model assumes that one instance will only be used in a single `Payment`.\n\n__Example:__\n\nÉdouard Manet sold his painting, Jeanne, to Antonin Proust in 1883 for 3,000 francs.\n\n",

For example, it might be known how much commission went to an auction house or for the sale of objects by consignment, particularly if this comes from the stock books or records of the company. Artists might be paid a commission in advance for the production of an object, or agents might be paid a commission for finding and purchasing objects on behalf of the new owner.
