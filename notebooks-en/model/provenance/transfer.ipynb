The object might have been sold or otherwise changed ownership, or it might have been only on loan. While this could theoretically be handled by a transfer of an indeterminate [property right](../rights), this would be very complex and give the impression of more information being available than is actually the case. Instead, we add a new class called `Transfer` which allows the indeterminate transfer of an object between two parties without claiming whether it is ownership, custody or something else entirely.\n\n\n## Transfer\n\nThe class for indeterminate transfers is `Transfer`, and has three properties beyond the core activity properties:\n\n* **transferred**: references the object or objects being transferred\n* **transferred_from**: references the people or groups from whom the object(s) are being transferred\n* **transferred_to**: references the people or groups to which the object(s) are being transferred\n\nThis mirrors the other classes such as `Acquisition`, `TransferOfCustody`, and `Move`.\n\n\n__Example:__\n\nA painting is transferred between two people, however it is not clear whether it was permanent or merely a loan.\n\n",
