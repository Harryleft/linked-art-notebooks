Events and activities occur at a place, objects exist at some location, and people and organizations have associated locations where they reside or are otherwise associated with. Places are extents in space, independent of time or what may or may not be present in that space. For built works such as architecture and works that are fixed in location due to their media (a cave drawing for example), Place is a defining characteristic.\n\nPlaces also form a core integration point with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and map based user interfaces. By aligning with these other systems, we enable better usability and interactivity with our data. It is assumed that places are terrestrial, however this is also not necessarily the case. The Solar System is just as much a Place as the city of Paris.\n\n\n## Core Information\n\nAll of the core information for entities is available for Place, including identifiers, classifications, labels, names, statements, equivalents and so forth.\n\nIt is recommended that external gazeteer systems be used for recording the spatial hierarchy of Places, however it is still useful to be able to position historical locations within their larger geospatial context.  This uses the same partitioning pattern as all other classes in the model.\n\n__Example:__\n\nThere is a city called Amsterdam in the Netherlands.\n\n",

   "source": "\n\n## Geospatial Location\n\nOne of the expected user interface requirements for places is the ability to plot them on a map.  In order to do this, or to calculate the geospatial overlap of places, it is useful to have a geometry that describes the place's boundaries in the real world. This could be very detailed, a simple bounding box within which the place fits, or a point close to the center of the area.\n\nThis is handled by associating a [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) string with the place using the `defined_by` property.\n\nThe coordinate reference system is assumed to use latitude and longitude. Future versions of the specification might have more detail about different coordinate systems (such as non-earthbound locations or relative positioning).\n\n\n__Example:__\n\nA polygon that (very approximately) defines the country of New Zealand.\n\n",

It may be desirable to capture the exact location separately from a broader area that is known, especially when that approximation is very uncertain. If the place is the exact location of several events, and a name for the place is available but not exact geospatial coordinates or a full address, then this pattern is especially valuable. This is managed using the `part_of` construction -- the specific place is somewhere within the broader area.\n\n\n__Example:__\n\nMany art sales take place in auction houses over time, and while the city might be known, the exact address within the city might not be and it could be misleading to collect all of the art sales within the entire city together.\n\n",

While rare, there are situations when buildings are moved between locations. The building, just like a painting, is thus modeled as an object that has a current location in space. Activities take place in the place, rather than in the object.  The granularity of the place compared to the building may be different due to underlying data management.\n\nThis applies to any other \"immovable\" object as well, such as large stellae through pyramids, ruins, or any other constructed object that might otherwise be \"permanently\" at a particular location.\n\n\n__Example:__\n\nThe [Frank Lloyd Wright House](https://crystalbridges.org/frank-lloyd-wright/) was originally built in New Jersey, and subsequently moved to its current location in Arkansas.\n\n",
