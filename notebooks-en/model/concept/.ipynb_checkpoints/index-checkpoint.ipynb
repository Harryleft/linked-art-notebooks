    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Concepts are an important aspect of Linked Art, and encompass \"units of thought\" from classifications of objects or other entities, to languages, materials and beyond. For the most part, Linked Art leverages the Getty's Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) for concepts rather than defining our own, however the model only [requires](/model/vocab/required/) the use of AAT terms in a very limited number of situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it is useful or necessary to define a new concept, or to redefine an existing one in order to add new information, then we can fully describe them using this part of the model, rather than merely reference an external URI.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concept Classes \n",
    "\n",
    "There are five core classes for concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Type` is the catch-all, general concept class. The following classes are sub-classes of it.\n",
    "* `Currency` is a financial currency. Instances of it are used as the value of the `currency` property for monetary amounts. This is typically only needed for detailed [provenance](/model/provenance/acquisition/) information.\n",
    "* `Language` is a language understood natively by humans, including via speech, writing or gesture. Instances of it are used as the value of the `language` property on Linguistic Objects.\n",
    "* `Material` is a physical material type, such as wood, gold or oil paint. Instances of it are used as the value of the `made_of` property on Human-Made Objects.\n",
    "* `MeasurementUnit` is a unit that clarifies how to understand the value of a dimension, such as seconds, meters or kilograms. Instances of it are used as the value of the `unit` property on Dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the classes above are used in the regular `type` property, but care should be taken to use the right class whenever possible rather than always falling back to `Type`.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Partitioning versus Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to concepts, it is easy to confuse the distinction between the concept being a part of a broader concept, and being classified as a type of concept. The broader concept is a concept that the narrower concept is part of, along with others. The broader concept is a more general concept than the narrower one. For example visual works is a broader or more general concept than the concept of paintings, animals is a more general concept than mammals, European is a more general concept than Dutch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely a second concept that classifies the first would be one that categorizes it but doesn't encompass it directly. For example, type of work is the category for the concept of painting, taxonomic rank would be a category for mammals, and nationality would be a category for Dutch. These concepts that categorize other concepts are often called \"meta-types\" and are also discussed in the [base patterns](/model/base/#types-of-types).\n",

    "This model is heavily influenced by and highly compatible with [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) the Simple Knowledge Organization System specification from the W3C. Concepts in Linked Art could easily be skos:Concepts, with different types of name (called labels in skos), descriptions/notes, narrower and broader concepts and other relationships. Coordinated concepts are managed through the creation influences pattern. Concept Schemes in SKOS are modeled as Sets in Linked Art. \n",
