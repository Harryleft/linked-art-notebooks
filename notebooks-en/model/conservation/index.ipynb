In particular, there are condition assessments, conservation activities, and conservation projects which encapsulate the previous two. Condition assessments are when a curator or conservator assesses the state of an object, and the extent to which conservation intervention is needed. Conservation activities are physical modifications of the object to improve its condition.\n\nOther sections of the Linked.Art model also relate to conservation:\n\n* [Statements](/model/base/#statements-about-an-entity) can be about the object's state or conservation related activities\n* Sampling as an activity is described under [Production by removal](/model/object/production/#production-by-removal)\n\n\n## Condition Assessment\n\nCondition Assessment describes an activity during which an object is examined and its preservation condition or types of damage are identified. The condition type is assigned as classification to the object. \n\n__Example:__\n\nThe Rijksmuseum checked the condition of The Night Watch, at the beginning of the project \"Operation Night Watch\"\n\n",

For example, a condition check of a collection which involves checking multiple objects, or conservation activity which starts with a condition check and continues with interventive conservation work. \n\nConservation Projects have all of the regular properties and relationships, as documented in the [baseline patterns](/model/base/). In particular, the relationships to actors, places and time reflect the overall event.  \n\n__Example:__\n\nOperation Night Watch is a conservation and research project about The Night Watch\n\n",
