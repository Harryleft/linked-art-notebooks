    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes how to model information about activities typically undertaken as part of the care and conservation of objects. In particular, there are condition assessments, conservation activities, and conservation projects which encapsulate the previous two. Condition assessments are when a curator or conservator assesses the state of an object, and the extent to which conservation intervention is needed. Conservation activities are physical modifications of the object to improve its condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other sections of the Linked.Art model also relate to conservation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Statements](/model/base/#statements-about-an-entity) can be about the object's state or conservation related activities\n",
    "* Sampling as an activity is described under [Production by removal](/model/object/production/#production-by-removal)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Condition Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "Condition Assessment describes an activity during which an object is examined and its preservation condition or types of damage are identified. The condition type is assigned as classification to the object. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Example:__\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rijksmuseum checked the condition of The Night Watch, at the beginning of the project \"Operation Night Watch\"\n",
